    "Superconducting qubits leverage the quantum behavior of superconducting circuits. These are electrical circuits made of superconducting materials that can carry an electric current without resistance when cooled to very low temperatures. The quantum behavior arises when these circuits are reduced to very small sizes, making them sensitive to quantum effects. A few of the primary types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transmon Qubits \n",
    "\n",
    "An evolution of the Cooper pair box qubit, the transmon has been designed to be less sensitive to charge noise, which was a limitation in earlier designs. It is one of the most widely used superconducting qubits due to its relatively long coherence times and ease of fabrication. The qubit state is determined by the number of Cooper pairs that have tunneled across a Josephson junction.\n",

The two states of the qubit (often labeled as |0⟩ and |1⟩) correspond to the clockwise and counter-clockwise circulating current states. They are sensitive to magnetic noise but can be designed to be less sensitive to charge noise.\n",

However, SQUID devices have been used in the design of certain types of superconducting qubits to enhance tunability or readout mechanisms. In the context of qubits, a SQUID loop (a loop with one or two Josephson junctions) can be used to create a tunable barrier or inductance which can influence the qubit behavior.\n",

The advantage of this design is that the qubit is better isolated from its environment, leading to longer coherence times. These cavities are typically made of aluminum, and the qubit can be viewed as a non-linear resonator inside this cavity. The 3D design offers better protection against certain types of noise and decoherence mechanisms that plague the 2D counterparts.\n",

Similarly, a cat qubit is in a superposition of two coherent states. These states are macroscopically distinct, making the cat qubit a type of \"macroscopic quantum\" system. Cat qubits can be realized in superconducting circuits using Josephson junctions and resonators, where the qubit states are superpositions of large photon number states in the resonator. One of the advantages of cat qubits is their potential resilience to certain types of errors, but they also come with challenges in preparation, control, and readout.\n",

    "## Trapped Particles\n",
    "\n",
    "Trapped particles offer another avenue for quantum computation, distinct from the solid-state devices like superconductors. These systems exploit the quantum nature of individual atoms or ions, using various trapping and cooling techniques. Let's delve into each category:\n",

    "Trapped ion quantum computing is one of the pioneering methods in quantum computation. It involves manipulating individucal ions (charged atoms) using electromagnetic fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ion Trapping: At the heart of this approach is the ion trap - a device that can confine ions in a small region of space using electromagnetic fields. Two main types of traps are used: linear Paul traps and Penning traps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Gates with Ions: Once ions are trapped, laser beams are used to initialize, manipulate, and read out the quantum state of the ions. Two-qubit quantum gates are achieved by harnessing the Coulomb interaction between ions, which allows quantum information to be transferred between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages & Challenges: Trapped ions boast long coherence times, high-fidelity gate operations, and the ability to scale by interconnecting multiple traps. However, challenges include mitigating unwanted heating and ensuring precise control of the lasers and magnetic fields.\n",

    "Companies like IonQ and Honeywell are at the forefront of developing trapped ion quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neutral Atom Qubits:\n",

    "Creating Rydberg Atoms: A neutral atom (e.g., rubidium) is excited using lasers to a high-energy state where one of its electrons orbits far from the nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rydberg Blockade: When two Rydberg atoms come close together, their interactions prevent a third atom nearby from being excited to a Rydberg state. This phenomenon can be used to mediate interactions between qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages & Challenges: The strong interactions between Rydberg atoms allow for rapid quantum gate operations. However, these same interactions can lead to unwanted noise and decoherence, requiring careful control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cold Atom Qubits:\n",
    "Cold atom quantum computing exploits the quantum behavior of atoms cooled to near absolute zero temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laser Cooling: Techniques like Doppler cooling and evaporative cooling are used to cool down a cloud of neutral atoms to temperatures just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC): At these ultra-low temperatures, atoms can form a new state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate, where they behave as a single quantum entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Gates with Cold Atoms: Interactions within the BEC, or between cold atoms, can be harnessed for quantum computation. This can involve using the collective behavior of atoms in the BEC or isolating individual atoms for qubit operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages & Challenges: Cold atoms can have long coherence times and are isolated from many types of environmental noise. However, ensuring precise control, maintaining the ultra-cold temperatures, and achieving reliable quantum gates remain challenges.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we will give an overview of the entire system and briefly touch upon all layers. Over the subsequent 4-6 chapters, we will delve deeper into the quantum chip (qubits) layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each qubit necessitates the use of a specific material. These materials must contain particles suitable for creating the qubits while remaining uncontaminated by other particles. As a result, it is critical to 'grow' these required materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully grasp the concepts presented herein, we will need certain mathematical tools. The mathematical basics will be explained in the chapters on Ket notation.\n",

    "In the following segments, we will discuss the broader aspects of a quantum computer: from programming it to interpreting the results. The first term we want to emphasize is *compute*. In reality, we are not merely building a quantum computer; we are developing a quantum accelerator. Specifically, we are creating a computational device that can be connected to a classical processor, which will then provide the performance required for various applications that are beyond the reach of classical computing. The concept of a heterogeneous multicore architecture offers a global view of our current understanding in this domain.\n",

    "That is very important to understand, so whatever we are going to discuss in the following talks is only going to focus on the quantum accelerator device or the application processes that we need classically as well as quantumly to be provided\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we talk about a computer, classically we have divided that in different layers; the lowest layer is always let's say the hardware, the\n",
    "\n",
    "1. chip that has been designed. It is never a single chip or a single processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (Quantum to Classical) No, it has memory, it has interconnections, so a bus that allows the processor to communicate with the memory to retrieve instructions and to retrieve or produce the data. And then it goes up to the\n",
    "3. Microarchitecture that we need, up to the application level. We will now go in detail on each of those layers in a quantum context. Because we are basically adopting the same kind of layer view of what a quantum accelerator or a quantum computer would be, and we simply put the Q of quantum in front of every layer. And that is our research and working program. The highest level is the 7 (4) quantum algorithm that we know of. We don't even know yet what they will be. We have examples such as factorization that is used in cryptography in securing communication between machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "But quantum algorithms can as well be designing a new molecule for personalized medicine. It can be that you might want to have a climate module that you want to run on your quantum accelerator that take all kind of mechanisms into account that we currently are unable to compute or even model on a classical machine. So that is the quantum algorithm layer, and that is where the biggest opportunity lies worldwide. Where many companies and organizations can actually start developing their own quantum application. Because every company or every end-user can think of how they can use that computational aspects of such a device.\n",
    "\n",
    "One layer lower is that when you have an application that you need to program. You do that classically again. You have a programming language such as C++, Fortran, Cobol or any language that you can think of. Those languages can produce the code for a classical processor. But we also have to develop our own quantum language for the quantum accelerator. There are a couple of languages that have been developed so far. There is ScaffCC, and ProjectQ. And here at QuTech we are developing our own programming language called OpenQL, which is inspired by OpenCL, which is a language developed for GPU programming. We are now shifting it to the quantum infrastructure, so making the changes to that language. So that is the programming language layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every programming language we need a compiler. A compiler takes the input of your algorithmic logic and compiles it into a lower level language that is classically called an assembly language. Again here we are working on a quantum assembly language which we call QASM, which was originally developed for a book 'Quantum computation and information' by Nielsen and Chuang. To generate the figures in their book of the quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just expanded that language into a full-fledged quantum assembly that is being generated by our OpenQL compiler, which is the programming language that we also developed. So that you can express your quantum logic in such a way. We are internationally collaborating with other partners working on similar things such that we standardize this quantum assembly language. Because for now everybody has its own local version, and that is not very good that everybody has his own variation, but if we all agree that this is what we assume to be QASM, then progress will come much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next layer is quantum arithmetic's because the mathematics of what you need to do is completely different than classically. The quantum gates operate quite differently, that's why you need to develop the quantum arithmetic; how to do a quantum operation. I will not say anything about run-time, which is another part that we need in a quantum accelerator. Because we will need it, but what kind of functionality it should have is a bit unclear right now. That is where there is the tension between the compiler development because we still can develop a lot of things in the compiler and maybe at a later stage we will develop that in a run-time support.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this QASM basically maps very well one on one with the quantum instruction set. This quantum instruction set basically describes what the operations are that your quantum device is capable of executing. That is why we have to think of what these instructions are. We know that classically we use an assignment like A = B + C. We should be able to do something similar in a quantum device. But it is not as simple as retrieving data from a memory location and perform the addition and writing back the result, because in quantum we use qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A qubit is a quantum bit. Classically, we reason in terms of bits, zeros and ones. And as you know we are now using qubits, quantum bits. And they can be also zero or one, but they can also be zero and one at the same time. And that is the famous superposition that we are exploiting in a quantum device. We can also combine two qubits so we don't have two different states but we have a combination of those states; namely 4 states at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "we have 2^3 = 8 states. Now what is very nice about quantum is that the quantum mechanics gives us parallelism for free. Because I can apply quantum gates on those 2^n different states. You will come to understand in the upcoming lectures that nothing really comes for free. There is still a lot of challenges that need to be resolved. But that is ultimately the big challenge and the big opportunity that quantum offers. That is why you have to understand what this instruction set is and the corresponding architecture should be. And that immediately brings us to the layer of the micro-architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any classical processors we have also a quantum micro architecture for my quantum device, which contains the processor, the memory and also the interconnects of how the processor will communicate with the qubits. It has local registers in the processor and an ALU, an arithmetic logical unit so that it can compute logical and arithmetical operations, and write back the result to memory so that the user gets an idea of what the algorithm has computed as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "So again here in the quantum case we have a micro-architecture which has a similar kind of functionality. And that is the one we are also currently implementing in a real device that already controls a number of the physical qubits; a superconducting as well as a spin qubit that we are developing at QuTech. For now we are working on a 17 qubit micro-architecture, so that in principle we can go up to 2^17 parallel executions on the combination of those 17 qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A layer lower is the quantum to classical layer. Because whatever you perform on the quantum level is always an analog phenomenon. Now you say; \"analog? I thought we were building a computer? Which should be digital...\". Well, everything up to the micro-architecture is clearly digital, but ultimately what you send down to the quantum chip is for example a microwave, it can be other things, but let's say it is a microwave and we control an individual electron at the atomic level. The individual electron is important to understand. So if I have 17 qubits, I basically have 17 electrons, not hundred thousands, not millions, but 17. And there are ways to combine those 17 electrons and their spins in the way that they interact and move that indicates that they are doing a particular calculation. So that means that this layer is necessary for translating all of the logical steps that you need to do in your algorithm into the appropriate microwave or the physical signal that you want to send to this electron and to the qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then ultimately it enters into the quantum chip. Which consists of these qubits which are connected to each other. And then we hope of course that we get a meaningful result. Now it is never the less important to understand for a quantum accelerator for any computational device is that it is a non-deterministic way of computing. That means that it is not like in a classical machine that you run a thousand times exactly the same algorithm and you will get a thousand times exactly the same result. Quantumly this is absolutely not true, because when you want to read out the result several things happen. The most important is that any entangled superposition that exists, actually is going to get destroyed. So if I have for example 2^17 possibilities, I am only going to get one of those possibilities back as a result. And all the others will disappear.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is why you maybe have to do a computation 10 times, maybe 100 times, we don't even know how many times we need to do that. And then you can make a histogram of what has been computed, and the readout that has the highest frequency of occurrence has a high probability of being read out by our micro-architecture and that is what we can report back to the end user. So that is something that you should not forget. A quantum device is a very powerful device, it gives massive parallelism in principle. But we need multiple runs and average out what those calculations of those results are. And the one with the highest frequency is the most likely result of your quantum device.\n",

    "# Quantum materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum materials are an essential feature if one would like to build a quantum computer or use the quantum internet. On a daily basis, Giordano Scappucci is working on optimizing quantum materials at QuTech. He will introduce you to this field of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics describes how atoms bind and electrons interact at a fundamental level. Naively speaking, all materials are quantum because all matter, in the end, must be explained by quantum mechanics. For example, our body is largely made up of water. In water, chemical reactions bind hydrogen and oxygen atoms together. Although this can be explained by quantum mechanics, we usually don't think about water in these terms, and a high-school-level chemistry description does the job. This is, because we can often approximate the quantum behaviour in materials by a classical description. It turns out that a classical description is in fact suitable for most of the phenomena that we experience in the macroscopic world around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, however, to fully understand the behaviour of certain materials, it is necessary to keep quantum in view: there is no classical explanation to help our understanding. A feature of the broad category of Quantum Materials is that their behaviour is generally rooted in the quantum world. And while behaviours observed in quantum materials cover a wide spectrum, there are some common features that recur.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, many quantum materials derive their properties from reduced dimensionality. Electrons trapped in 2, 1, or 0 dimensions have different characteristics than electrons in 3D. Emergence is another recurring theme across quantum materials. Phenomena emerge due to the collective behaviour of original constituents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In superconductor materials, the interaction between electrons, mediated by vibrations of the crystal lattice, creates the so-called Cooper pairs. Differently from individual electrons, Cooper pairs can share the same quantum state. Superconductivity emerges from the concerted state of pairs that propagates without electrical resistance through the crystal. Certainly, you need quantum mechanics to understand this!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first quantum revolution, with the development of quantum mechanics, provided a microscopic understanding of nature. It had a tremendous impact in our life. Once you understand the periodic table and electronic wave functions, you understand semiconductors and how transistors are built and work. We now carry around billions of transistors in our pockets to perform complex tasks. It is clear that we need the concept of the photon to understand the laser.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently in the midst of a second quantum revolution, in which quantum matter is engineered to develop disruptive technologies beyond the reach of classical understanding. Quantum computing is the man on the moon goal of such second quantum revolution. By working in a fundamentally different way, quantum computers have the promise of solving complex problems that classical computers cannot handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum materials provide the environment where qubits, the elemental unit of quantum information processing, are defined and live. Therefore, quantum materials are at the basis of a quantum computer. To have a working quantum computer you need to couple together many qubits, while maintaining their long coherence time. These requirements are often conflicting. Qubits that are hard to couple together have long coherence times, because they tend to be isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, systems that are easy to couple together tend to lose coherence quickly, because they can be perturbed easily by the environment. In all cases, the precision of the qubit materials is crucial to solve these two challenging requirements. And when we say \"precision\", we mean precision in terms of: materials uniformity, chemical composition, and electrical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, to make the phenomenally large number of qubits necessary to build a quantum computer, we would like to use the same manufacturing techniques of the microelectronic industry. Chemical vapour deposition, or CVD, is an industrial process that uses high purity gases to make high quality materials, with desired physical and electronic properties. For example, by depositing layers of silicon and silicon-germanium, we can tune the lattice parameter of silicon to be larger than usual and match that one of silicon germanium. As a result, the electronic properties of such hetero-structure, which is made of different materials, make it possible to form a 2D electron gas at the interface between silicon and silicon-germanium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits can then be made by isolating with electric fields one electron spin at that interface. If you want to isolate one single electron spin and make it a qubit, you need to know the properties of the host material very well. Once we make our crystal into a silicon heterostructure, we usually break it, and have a close look at it from the side with a high-resolution electron microscope. We call this microscope a transmission electron microscope, or TEM. Its working principle is based on electronic diffraction, another quantum effect, of an electron beam passing through a thin piece of material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial resolution is so high that we are able to see atomic arrangements in the lattice. In addition, a TEM is capable of distinguishing different elements from each other by their atomic weight. Therefore, it is a useful tool to analyze materials composition. Light elements appear darker than heavy elements. This allows us to check precisely to what extent, the material we made matches our expectations. For example, you see here the perfect atomic arrangement of silicon and germanium atoms at the critical interface between silicon and silicon-germanium. The lattice spacing is exactly the same at both sides of the sharp interface, indicating that the CVD process successfully strained silicon to match the underlying silicon-germanium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we are able to make crystals with such precision and very little imperfections, is a key asset to then make good qubits. Once we know how the material we made looks like, we usually study its electronic properties, by modifying them with external parameters. Temperature, electric fields, and magnetic fields are the few knobs that we turn in our labs to probe quantum materials. These studies provide useful feedback to make the material a better environment for the qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for example, the Si heterostructure mentioned earlier. If we cool it to the very low temperatures at which qubits usually operate, say below one degree above absolute zero, it would be insulating. However, we can make the material conducting by imposing a vertical electric field. The electric field forms a metallic channel at the interface between silicon and silicon-germanium, which is then populated by electrons. The higher the electric field, the more the electrons in the channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "By studying how the electrical resistance of such channel responds to a magnetic field, we are able to measure the number of electrons in the channel and their mobility. The mobility tells us how fast electrons can travel in such channel, and is an indication of the disorder in the system. The higher the mobility, the lower the disorder, and there will be a better chance of fabricating many qubits with similar properties. Materials homogeneity is one requirement to scale up the number of qubits into a quantum computer. Think of the billions of transistors in your laptop, if they were all behaving differently, there would be no chance of having them to work for you. And while we are currently optimizing quantum materials to build a quantum computer, ultimately, the hope is that when such a machine will exist, one of the first uses will be to efficiently simulate quantum systems, fulfilling the vision put forward by Richard Feynmann more than 30 years ago. In turn, this will help us understand and build even more complex quantum materials with extraordinary properties that today we cannot even predict.\n",

    "But this is not that simple as it could be. There is a far easier way to see this, which we can do using the Bloch sphere. The action of this sequence of unitary operations. Y 90, x around some angle theta and then y minus 90 can be expressed in terms of matrices. But it’s much easier to see using the Bloch sphere. If we write down the Bloch sphere with the x axis pointing out of the board, we can see the effect of a y 90, a rotation around 90 degrees of the y axis, is just turning the sphere sort of like a steering wheel, so that the x axis now faces down and the z axis is where the x axis used to be. If we now apply a rotation around the x axis, that is giving us a rotation around our old z axis. And once we have that done, all we have to do is reverse the y 90 with a y minus 90 to restore the orientation of our original axes, having picked up a phase on the z. And that’s how we can synthesize a diagonal unitary. e^{itheta/2}, e^{-i*theta/2} out of the operations to which the experimentalists have access. A little bit of notations saves you a lot of hardware design.\n",

    "## State decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in quantum computing , it is necessary to express one state in terms of a basis of some other states. I am going to go ahead and call this state decomposition, although you can see it under a variety of names and usually it’s clear from the context that they mean expressing one state in terms of a basis that is more familiar or convenient to. Now the rule of state decomposition is that any state phi can be expressed as a sum over k terms, where each term consists of an inner product of phi - the trial state - with one of the basis states phi_k, and the states phi_k. Number times vector. And this is the same as decomposing a vector in a basis if you are already familiar with linear algebra.\n",

    "As an example of this, let’s take a look at a trial wave function of zero, and a basis which is the Hadamard basis, the plus minus basis, that we reviewed in the lecture. The sum over psi_k, phi, psi_k is then the inner product of plus and zero times plus and the inner product of minus and zero times minus. Now here I figured out those inner product. The inner product of plus zero is one over root two times the dot product of these two vectors, which is just one over root two. And the calculation for minus zero is very similar, there is a minus sign here, but it gets multiplied by zero, making no difference, and we end up with one over root two again. Therefore, zero can be decomposed as one over root two, plus + minus, just as the plus state can be decomposed as one over root two, zero + one.\n",

And we’re going to add to that: beta-beta-star, minus beta-alpha-star, minus alpha-beta-star and alpha-alpha-star. Now, beta-star-beta plus alpha-alpha-star is just the magnitude of alpha squared plus the magnitude of beta squared, which is 1. And we see that same thing in the top term here, alpha-star-alpha plus beta-beta-star, that’s 1. And then these inner terms cancel. Because you have alpha-star-beta minus beta-alpha-star, that has just been flipped here. And a beta-star-alpha minus alpha-beta-star, if I flipped these two, it becomes obvious that they are equal and opposite, so they cancel. This implies for example, that for example if Alice and Bob share a Bell state, and Alice measure in a 0-1 basis, she can get a state 0 or 1 and she can tell that Bob has the same state. Now she measures instead in the basis psi-star psi-star-perp, she can tell that Bob has the state psi or psi-perp depending on her measurement result.\n",

    "In this section we will explain the difference between measurements that occur in a laboratory and measurements that are described in theory. What are the differences and how are those similar?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take this opportunity to clarify something that confuses a lot when first learning about quantum mechanics, which is the difference between measurements that occur in a laboratory and measurements that we describe in theory. And also point out hopefully the ways in which these things are similar. So, you may have already seen a picture like this one. But, in the laboratories we can measure some currents in nanoamperes, and if there’s a spin in the down state pointing parallel to the field, there will be no bump in the current. And if it’s in the up state, there will be a bump. And this is a large macroscopic classical signal that they can detect. And this relates to a measurement operator. You can imagine that we take the total area under this curve; the total amount of current, in the case that there’s no bump, and that corresponds to the spin down state. And the total current in the case that there is a bump will be slightly higher, and that corresponds to the spin up state. So, that real number: the amount of current times the projector on to the down state plus the total amount of current in the case that there is bump times the projector on to the up state gives us our measurement operator. Now, the important thing about these two signals being distinguishable, but there being a large difference between them, is that if they’re equal, we end up with some number times down-down plus some number which is identical, times up-up. So, the measurement operator becomes the identity, which doesn’t discern between the up and down states. So as useless is the measurement. But if these numbers are discernably different, then down-down and up-up receive different measurement outcomes, and out measurement operator is \\mathbf{1}more like a Z, which is one we could use to accurately distinguish between the computational basis states in quantum computing.\n",
