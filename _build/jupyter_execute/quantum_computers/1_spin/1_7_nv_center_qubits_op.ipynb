So, if we have the same time before and after this flip, then the effect of the field exactly cancels and the quantum state is protected. We call this a spin echo.

In this way, we can even protect the quantum state for over a second, so really over macroscopic time scales and about six orders of magnitude better than without flipping the electron. We thus have very good coherence for the electron spins. How can we now use this to control multiple nuclear spins in the environment? The key here is that if the electron spin is, let’s say, in a state pointing downwards, then it creates a dipolar magnetic field.\n",

This gives each nuclear spin a unique frequency, so that we can apply radiofrequency pulses that are resonant only with a particular targeted nuclear spin. We can selectively control the spins. Moreover, if we now flip the electron to its zero state, it does not create a magnetic field.\n",

    "What is the procedure explained in the lecture for connecting different NV centers to build a quantum network? We shine a laser onto an NV center and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The NV center reflects the light. This reflected light carries information about the quantum state, and is subsequently sent to a different NV. The collision of the light with the other NV causes it to carry that information too.\n",

    "- Measure the NV center to learn its state. This information is send to a different NV. Using this information we can manipulate the NV to reproduce the state at the first node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Excite the electron. As the electron falls back, a photon is emitted. This photon is sent to a different NV and subsequently collected by its electron, after which the electron has reproduced the state of the first excited electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly shine a laser on the other NV center. We let the photons, which are emitted due to electrons falling back, interfere. By measuring them, we effectively entangle the two NV centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Explanation </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflected light does not carry information and measuring would destroy the quantum state and any entanglement. Letting a second NV center absorb an emitted photon from the NV center is in theory possible, but experimentally very inefficient. To date, photon interference of the emitted photons from two NV centers is the best way to entangle distant nodes.\n",

    "```{admonition} Explanation\n",
    "Electrons in the valence band can move around freely, so information cannot be stored in the spin of such an electron, or transferred for the purpose of reading out a nuclear spin. This is because such an electron may randomly leave the valence band state that it sits in, and be replaced by another electron from the valence band. The electrons inside the band gap are protected from the valence band, so we can avoid these random substitutions.\n",
