    "\n",
    "In this lecture I will explain how we can perform measurement of superconducting qubits.\n",
    "At the end of every quantum algorithm, the computation result has to be obtained by performing measurement of the qubits. And, as dictated by the laws of quantum mechanics, any superposition states are projected into well-defined zeros and ones. A transmon qubit, as depicted here,\n",
    "can be measured via a readout resonator that is coupled to it. The resonance frequency of the resonator is quite far away from the qubit transition frequency, on the order of GHz.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, due to the coupling, there is a shift in the resonator’s frequency\n",
    "depending on the qubit state.\n",
    "This shift is evidenced here by the measured resonator transmission dips\n",
    "of the qubit in the ground state and the excited state.\n",
    "This shift is typically on the order of a few megahertz, three orders of magnitude smaller than the detuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe this shift and thereby the qubit state,\n",
    "by injecting the resonator with a pulse near the resonator frequency.\n",
    "The pulse, as shown here, is reflected by the resonator.\n",
    "Here, we show the output voltage as a function of time for the qubit in the ground state and the excited state,\n",
    "which clearly look different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we are able to distinguish and measure the two different qubit states. The traces I’ve just shown you, look very clean and distinguishable\n",
    "as they are averaged over thousands of measurements.\n",

    "However, for most real quantum protocols, we require to discern the qubit state in a just single run.\n",
    "But to avoid disturbing our precious quantum system,\n",
    "we can only use readout pulses that consist of a couple of photons.\n",
    "At these power levels, in the order of just a few femto Watts,\n",
    "we are struggling to distinguish the different quantum states\n",
    "as the signal is hampered by quantum noise, as depicted here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify how well qubit measurement is performing in the presence of this noise,\n",
    "we record the integrated voltage of thousands of individual traces.\n",
    "By plotting these individual shots in the histograms, we extract the fidelity of the measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fidelity expresses the probability that the measurement returns the right outcome averaged over the two possible qubit input states. Epsilon01 expresses the probability for erroneously getting outcome 1 for a ground state input and Epsilon10 vice versa. In this case, aided by the world’s lowest noise, superconducting amplifiers we can achieve a fidelity close to 98%. I’ve just shown you the readout of one qubit.\n",
    "Of course, a full quantum computer consists of many quantum bits\n",
    "and these quantum bits all have to be read out at the same time.\n",
    "To allow this simultaneous readout, we couple each qubit to its own readout resonator\n",
    "and choose the lengths of the resonators such that they resonate all at a distinct frequency. Just like the different strings in a piano.\n",
    "By next sending down a pulse that is the sum of multiple components,\n",
    "in this case two, each tuned to its own readout resonator,\n",
    "we can probe multiple readout resonators at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component will only be picked up by the targeted resonator.\n",
    "In the analysis of the output signals, we again separate the two different frequency components.\n",
    "Here, we show the readout results for qubit 1 for each of the four possible two-qubit basis states,\n",
    "indicating that the signal practically only depends on the state of the targeted qubit,\n",
    "separating 00 and 10 from 00 and 11.\n",

    "Dually, we here show the readout results for the other qubit,\n",
    "which separate 00 and 10 from 00 and 11.\n",
    "You might now be able to imagine how this readout scheme can be extended\n",
    "to measure ever increasing numbers of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we depicted a seventeen-qubit device where we play the simultaneous readout trick\n",
    "using seventeen readout resonators divided over three different input and output lines.\n",

    "This might sound to like a finished story.\n",
    "However, there are many improvements to be made still to get to a fully scalable quantum computer.\n",
    "Exemplary topics that are currently being addressed in research,\n",
    "and which might also be attractive for additional reading are:\n",
    "Advanced readout pulse shaping to quickly populate and depopulate the readout resonators to speed up the readout. Second, superconducting amplifiers to suppress noise in the readout amplification chain\n",
    "and methods to quantify their performance. And lastly we work on advanced readout topologies. In this case, using multiple cascaded readout resonators per qubit, to increase the flux of photons and further speed up the readout.\n",

    "## Single qubit gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will show how we control the state of a single superconducting transmon qubits,\n",
    "that is, doing so-called single-qubit gates.\n",
    "The state of a single qubit can be visualized on the Bloch sphere,\n",
    "with the ground and excited state on the poles\n",
    "and the other points on the surface corresponding to quantum superpositions.\n",

    "Single-qubit gates are then rotations of the Bloch sphere,\n",
    "for instance, here the X90 gate, which converts the ground and excited states into superpositions.\n",
    "We use the physical effect called Rabi oscillation:\n",

    "e2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We change the qubit state by applying an external oscillating electric field at the qubit frequency,\n",
    "corresponding to the energy difference between the ground and excited state.\n",
    "\n",
    "That frequency is usually in the microwave range, between 3 and 10 GHz.\n",
    "To apply the electric field, we need a microwave line that ends next to the transmon.\n",
    "We can use the same line that is also used for measurements,\n",
    "about which you will hear more in the next videos.\n",
    "Or, on larger devices with many qubits, we often make a dedicated drive line for each qubit.\n",
    "With this, we can generate the electric field close to only one selected qubit.\n",
    "Let’s see how the oscillating field affects the qubit state.\n",
    "When we apply it, it drives the qubit from the ground to the first excited state and back.\n",

    "On the Bloch sphere, this looks like a rotation with constant speed.\n",
    "The axis of rotation always lies in the x-y plane.\n",
    "We can control where exactly it lies by changing the phase of the applied field: A sine wave leads to a rotation around the x-axis,\n",
    "while a cosine with 90 degrees phase offset will induce a rotation around the y-axis. On the other hand, the speed of the rotation is proportional to the amplitude of the electric field. In order to perform a desired gate, for instance a rotation by 90 degrees around the x-axis, we thus need to apply a short pulse with the correct phase, amplitude and length.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation angle is determined by the product of length and amplitude,\n",
    "that is, by the area under the pulse envelope.\n",
    "This way, we can perform any rotation with the axis in the x-y plane.\n",
    "If we want to rotate around another axis, which does not lie in the x-y plane,\n",
    "we have to decompose it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that any single-qubit gate can be performed\n",
    "using no more than three microwave pulses in sequence.\n",
    "Of course, we want to make the pulses as short and strong as possible,\n",
    "to be able to do quantum computations quickly.\n",

    "However, the shorter the pulse,\n",
    "the more frequency components it has besides the transition frequency f01. We can see this by looking at the spectral decomposition of the pulse. Unfortunately, that means that if we make the pulses shorter and shorter, at some point, the spectrum is so broadthat the pulse drives oscillations not only between the states 0 and 1, but also 1 and 2! Then, the transmon does not work as a qubit anymore, since three transmon states are involved, and the nice Bloch sphere rotation picture breaks down. We must avoid this situation, and this limits us in making the pulses too short. To push the limit of how short we can make the pulse, instead of a square pulse, we need a pulse which is well localized in time and also frequency.\n",

    "A much better choice is a pulse with a Gaussian shaped envelope.\n",
    "It has the same area, but affects the 1-2 transition much, much less.\n",
    "Using a technique called derivative removal by adiabatic gate, or DRAG,\n",
    "we can push the limit further:\n",

    "\n",
    "By superimposing a fine-tuned out-of-phase component with an envelope proportional to the derivative of the original pulse, the rotation angle is unchanged, but the transitions to the 2 state are actively suppressed. Using this technique, pulse lengths can be reduced to well below 5 ns without the second transmon state being a concern. This concludes our quick look at how we control the state of individual transmon qubits using microwave pulses. In the next videos, Niels and Adriaan will show you how we measure the transmon state, and how we change the state of a transmon depending on the state of another transmon, to perform larger calculations.\n",

    "Main takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Qubit operations are done using Rabi oscillation by applying an external oscillating electric field at the transmons qubit.\n",
    "  Performing desired gates require a short pulse with the correct phase, amplitude and length. This way any rotation within the x-y plane can be performed.\n",
    "- The minimum duration of a pulse is limited due to the broadening of the frequency spectrum as pulses get shorter.\n",
    "- In case the frequency spectrum is to broad, not only oscillations between the 0 and 1 state occur, but also between 1 and 2.\n",
    "- To push the limit of this short pulse duration, a Gaussian shaped envelope is used in combination with a technique called Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG).\n",

    "Conclusion: to create a Bell pair on a set of transmon qubits, we need to perform one single-qubit operation (the Hadamard) and one multi-qubit operation (the CZ).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: The single qubit operation: the Hadamard\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hadamard matrix maps the computational basis $\\{\\mid0\\rangle,\\mid1\\rangle\\}$ (the eigenvectors of the Pauli Z) to the Hadamard or $X$ basis $$\\{\\mid+\\rangle,\\mid-\\rangle\\}$$ (the eigenvectors of the Pauli $X$ ), and vice versa. If we transform the $$0\\rangle$$ to the $\\mid+\\rangle$, when looking at the Bloch sphere, this means that we rotate from the $z$-axis to the $x$-axis. This can be done on a transmon qubit by applying an alternating electric field to it, with a certain phase delay.\n",
    "Around what axis do we need to rotate to perform the Hadamard operation on the $|0\\rangle$ state?\n",
    "Look at the picture of the Bloch sphere and the rotational axis on the 3rd slide in the video to determine this axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- X-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Y-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Z-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint (1 of 2):** The [mathjaxinline] \\ket{0} [matjaxinline] state is the +1 eigenstate of the Z operator. On the Bloch sphere, this means that it lies in the positive direction of the Z axis.\n",
    "**Hint (2 of 2):** Likewise, the [mathjaxinline] \\ket{+} [matjaxinline] state is the +1 eigenstate of the X operator. On the Bloch sphere, this means that it lies in the positive direction of the X axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer** <br>\n",
    "Correct: <br>\n",
    "If we rotate around this axis we can get from the z-axis to the x-axis. There is, however, still the matter of rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise. See the explanation (click 'see answer' button) for elaboration.\n",
    "**Explanation** <br>\n",
    "If we look at the Bloch sphere, we see that going from the z-axis (where the state lies) to the x-axis (where the lies) means rotating around the y-axis. However, we do not yet have specified if we are rotating in the clockwise or anticlockwise direction.\n",
    "Also, if we look at 3rd slide from the video with the Bloch sphere, we see that we can use either a phase offset of (lets call this option A) or (this is option B). Choosing this offset is als precisely choosing the rotational direction, as you can see in the slide. (For clarification: if you can't see the rotational direction clearly in the video, it goes in the clockwise direction from the viewers perspective. Looking from the origin, it goes anti-clockwise.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Rotational direction\n",
    "\n",

    "### Question 4: The CZ gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-qubit operation that we can use for transmon qubits, is, as mentioned before, the CZ gate. In the video on two-qubit operations on superconducting qubits, Adriaan mentions a problem in the implementation that needs to be strictly avoided.\n",
    "Which of the following is that problem?\n",
    "Check the box that applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Waiting too long, so that the target qubit gets flipped as well\n",
    "- **Accidentally transferring the $|0\\rangle$ state to the $|2\\rangle$ state (so outside of the qubit space!).**\n",
    "- Accidentally performing an CNOT instead of a CZ operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "Correct: This needs to be avaoided so as to confine the system to a two-dimensional subspace (or a qubit subspace).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a method of preparing Bell pairs, we might want to analyse these Bell pairs by measuring some of them, and checking if we indeed have the desired correlations. If we want to measure the qubits we need to couple them to readout-resonators, as explained in the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the qubit, we pulse it with an alternating electric signal. This signal is reflected, but also influenced by the state that the qubit is in. Therefore, by measuring the reflected signal, we can know in what state the qubit is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Measuring the qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "Single qubit operations are also done using electric pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "How are measurements and operations distinguished?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pulse for an operation has a positive phase, whereas the pulse for a measurement has a negative phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pulse for an operation is a Gaussian, whereas the pulse for a measurement is a block wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pulses for operations and measurements have different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pulse for a measurement is a much stronger signal when compared to the pulse for an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint (1 of 1):** What parameters of the pulse can you change freely?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "Correct: The resonators are designed with different lengths, so that couple to different frequencies.\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "The design of the resonator influences to what frequencies it couples the best (e.g. what frequencies resonate in the cavity). This means that you can design your qubit in such a way that operations and measurements need pulses with different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6: Measurements on multiple qubits at once\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we perform measurements on multiple qubits at the same time?\n",
    "\n",
    "- By coupling the qubits to resonators of different length, thereby altering the readout qubits' frequencies seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By aiming very carefully we can ensure that the sent pulse only reflects from the desired qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By rotating the qubits over the Bloch sphere using single qubit operations so that only the qubit that we want to measure is outside the eigenspace of the desired measurement operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the qubit measurement resonators are located at different physical locations, the phase of the reflected pulse will be different depending on what resonator it reflected from. From this, we can infer what qubit we have measured.\n",
    "  unanswered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint (1 of 1):** Think back to the previous question.\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "Correct: This is essentially the same as you're doing in the previous question, when comparing to single-qubit operations.\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "Just as we could couple the readout cavities to different frequencies than the ones we use for operations, we can also couple the different qubits readout cavities to different frequencies from each other. Problem solved!\n",
