    "In ? and ??, we discussed spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots and nitrogen-vacancy centers. Despite the differences, in both cases qubits were realized with the spin degree of freedom of the electron. It is now time to discover a totally new platform: superconducting qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a quantum computer is able to perform complex quantum algoithms it might need millions or even billions of qubits. Superconducting qubits are nowdays one of the most advanced platforms in the quantum community regarding the number of qubits, and many large companies, such as Google, Intel and IBM, are now investing in them. IBM Quantum experience is an online platform where users from the3 general public can already access a five-qubit processor and run small algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will entail the physics behind a transmon qubit, which is an example of a superconducting qubit. Remember that the elaborate expressions and notations are not meant to intimidate the avid learners. It will suffice to grasp the core concepts. If however, all those notations have got you enthused, then we recommend you to go through all the different nuances and enhance your learning; because courses like these are not just meant to be passed and forgotten, are they?\n",

    "This has advantages and disadvantages.On the bright side, we have freedom to design! In a sense, we can play god designing artificial atoms. However, fabrication uncertainty keeps us from making any two qubits the same! For this reason, we like to say that qubits have individual personality! While the form of the Hamiltonian describing them quantum mechanically is well known, the parameters of this Hamiltonian cannot be perfectly targeted in fabrication. This has interesting implications for scaling up our quantum processors, which I will discuss in a later video. But back to design. Superconducting qubits generally consist of superconducting electrodes, or islands, that are interconnected by Josephson junctions. The Hamiltonian typically consists of two non-commuting contributions, one capacitive and one inductive. The first tends to localize Cooper pairs.\n",
    "The second favors their tunnelling from one island to another, in other words, their hopping. There exist numerous varieties of superconducting qubits: the charge qubit, the flux qubit, the phase qubit, the fluxonium, and many more. These qubit types differ in terms of the number of superconducting islands, the number of junctions, and, also importantly, the relative energy scales of the capacitive and inductive terms. Typically, superconducting qubits work in the frequency range between 4 and 8 GHz, approximately. This frequency, let’s call it f*{01}, is related via Planck’s constant to the energy difference E*{01}\n",
    "between the quantum levels that we assign as states 0 and 1.f\\_{01} is also the frequency of the microwave pulses that we need\n",
    "to induce coherent transitions between these levels.\n",

    "The capacitive term is quadratic on the charge accumulated on one island, the opposite charge is accumulated in the other. The inductive term is quadratic on the flux through the inductor. This charge and this flux do not commute. In fact, they are canonically conjugate variables. A direct correspondence between this Hamiltonian can be made to that of the simple harmonic oscillator by mapping flux to the position of the mass and charge to the mass’ momentum.\n",

    "Physics students will thus not be surprised to learn that the spectrum of the quantized LC oscillator is perfectly harmonic: levels are equally spaced in energy! This equal spacing is given by a familiar formula: one over root LC. But unfortunately, a harmonic spectrum does not a good qubit make! It is very difficult to confine the dynamics to just two levels, so ‘leakage’ out of the qubit subspace is a permanent threat.That is why the transmon differs from the LC oscillator in a fundamental way.\n",

    "In the transmon, the inductance is provided by a Josephson junction and not by a typical coil inductor. The inductive energy for the junction is not quadratic, but a cosine function of the generalized flux through it. This difference has important consequences for the spectrum: crucially, it disrupts the harmonic spectrum in ways that are very practical. At typical parameter values deep in the so-called transmon regime, where the energy scale of the inductive term is much larger than that of the charging termand let’s say, for the frequency f\\_{01} of about 6 GHz, the transition from the first to the second-excited state is lower by approximately 300 MHz.\n",

Well, it’s not exactly open. The resonator at this end couples capacitively to a feedline that will be used later to interrogate the scattering properties of the resonator near its fundamental frequency. This fundamental mode corresponds to the length matching approximately one quarter of the wavelength.\n",

    "This dependence of the resonator frequency on qubit state is the key ingredient allowing qubit readout. We can interrogate the resonator, and thereby also the qubit, by measuring the transmission properties of a microwave pulse applied to the feedline with a frequency close the bare fundamental. Niels will cover this in greater detail in his video.\n",

Your job is to drag and drop each of the four blue boxes to the corresponding zone below. This means that you are expected to map a component on the chip to its correct purpose. Note that there is a strict one-to-one correspondence between the components and the purposes, meaning that there is a purpose (i.e. zone) for every component (i.e. blue box); and each zone can have one and only one blue box.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "While connecting to the outside world, the I/O ports on Surface-17 chip do not connect through the edges (i.e. they do not connect horizontally); instead they connect in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the chip (i.e. they connect vertically).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this quiz, you will be tested on the content from the Introduction to Superconducting Qubits series. Questions 1 to 7 are based on the transmon qubit; question 8 briefly delves into concepts introduced in circuit QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: The transmon qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "A transmon qubit is an example of which of the following?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flux qubit\n",
    "\n",

    "### Question 2: A quantised LC circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transmon qubit and LC oscillator** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Having started on a lighter (and perhaps, an easier) note, let us now inspect how similar or different a transmon qubit is compared to an LC oscillator. For this purpose, we will first focus on a quantised LC circuit.\n",
    "In the video, it has been mentioned that the angular frequency $(\\omega)$ to transition from one level to the next in a quantised LC circuit is related to the inductance $(L)$ and capacitance $(C)$ values as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the transition frequency $(f)$ of that circuit is related to the angular frequency $(\\omega)$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega=2 \\pi \\cdot f\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this information to answer the following question.\n",
    "In a quantised LC circuit, what is the transition frequency $(f)$ for going from one level to the next if the inductance offered by the coil is $1.6$ Henry and the capacitance is $0.1 \\mu$ Farad? (Note that $1 \\mu \\operatorname{Farad}=10^{-6} \\mathrm{Farad}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{5000}{2 \\pi}$ Hertz\n",
    "$\\frac{2500}{2 \\pi}$ Hertz\n",
    "$\\frac{1250}{2 \\pi}$ Hertz\n",
    "$\\frac{625}{2 \\pi}$ Hertz\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "It is intuitive that $f=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\cdot \\sqrt{L C}}$. Now simply plugging in $L=1.6$ and $C=10^{-7}$ into the aforementioned formula gives the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Transition frequency in LC oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this transition frequency remain the same for transition among any two consecutive levels in a quantised LC circuit?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Yes**\n",
    "- No\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Transition frequency in transmon qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "If the transition frequency of going from level 0 to level 1 in the circuit for a transmon qubit is $f_{0,1}$, then is the transition frequency of going from level 1 to level 2 (i.e. $f_{1,2}$ ) in the same circuit also equal to $f_{0,1}$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- yes\n",
    "- **No**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "The spacing between the levels in a circuit for a transmon qubit is not harmonic. This is why we can use it as a qubit!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Josephson junction\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the implication of the use of a Josephson junction in a transmon instead of simply using an inductor (as in case of an LC oscillator) ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It is possible to confine the system of qubit(s) to the lowest two levels.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to go from a two-dimensional system of qubit(s) to a three-dimensional system of qutrit(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to achieve transition between any two consecutive levels of the system by always applying the same frequency.\n",
    "  Submit\n",
    "  You have used 0 of 2 attempts\n",
    "  Save\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "Qubits are two-dimensional systems. Hence, to create a qubit, it is necessary to confine the system to just two levels. The use of an inductor leads to uniformly spaced energy levels. In such a case, it is difficult to confine the system to just two levels (since the application of same frequency causes transition between any two consecutive levels). However, using a Josephson junction helps ensure that the spacing between the energy levels of the system is non-uniform; and therefore, application of a particular frequency corresponds to only one particular kind of level transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having learnt the similarity/difference between a transmon qubit and an LC oscillator, let us now streamline our focus completely towards the transmon qubit with a couple questions!\n",
    "What are the three essential parts of a transmon qubit? (Mark all that apply)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capacitor**\n",
    "- **Islands**\n",
    "- Inductor\n",
    "- **Josephson junction**\n",
    "- Resistor\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the components, the circuit for a transmon qubit is quite similar to (but not excatly the same as) the circuit for an LC oscillator. An inductor is used in a quantised LC circuit (which has harmonic energy levels). Since we want the energy-level spacing to be anharmonic, a Josephson junction is used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7: Adding additional Josephson junction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you add an additional Josephson junction?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To add an extra qubit on the chip.\n",
    "- To lower the resistance and consequently the amount of heat dissipated.\n",
    "- **To tune the inductive element and consequently the qubit transition frequency.**\n",
    "- It is not possible to add an additional Josephson junction without adding an extra level to the system (i.e. transitioning from a two level system to a three level system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "As seen in Question 2 of this quiz, the transition frequency is a function of inductance. By adding an additional Josephson junction, it is possible to regulate the inductance, and in turn, the frequency $f_{i, i+1}$ (where $i$ denotes the lower level of the two-level system).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are the resonators for readout and coupling separate on the second generation processors for superconducting qubits?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to scale up from a two-level system to a four-level system without making any other modifications to the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the conflict existing among the optimal parameters for readout and the optimal parameters for coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate two-qubit gating operations using readout resonators and measurement operations using coupling resonators, almost simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The readout and coupling resonators are common; in fact, they are mutliplexed so as to perform only one kind of operation at an instance.\n",
