<p>Some of the aforementioned qubit types and approaches are subsets or special cases of others, and they can be grouped together based on their fundamental principles or the materials used. Let‚Äôs reorganize and cluster some of them:</p>

<li><p><strong>Basic Superconducting Qubits:</strong>
Superconducting qubits leverage the quantum behavior of superconducting circuits. These are electrical circuits made of superconducting materials that can carry an electric current without resistance when cooled to very low temperatures. The quantum behavior arises when these circuits are reduced to very small sizes, making them sensitive to quantum effects. A few of the primary types include:</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="transmon-qubits">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7"><span class="section-number">1.21.1.1.1. </span>Transmon Qubits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#transmon-qubits" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h4>
<p>An evolution of the Cooper pair box qubit, the transmon has been designed to be less sensitive to charge noise, which was a limitation in earlier designs. It is one of the most widely used superconducting qubits due to its relatively long coherence times and ease of fabrication. The qubit state is determined by the number of Cooper pairs that have tunneled across a Josephson junction.</p>
</section>
<section id="flux-qubits">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8"><span class="section-number">1.21.1.1.2. </span>Flux Qubits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#flux-qubits" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h4>
<p>These qubits utilize the magnetic flux threading a superconducting loop, which contains one or more Josephson junctions. The two states of the qubit (often labeled as |0‚ü© and |1‚ü©) correspond to the clockwise and counter-clockwise circulating current states. They are sensitive to magnetic noise but can be designed to be less sensitive to charge noise.</p>

<p>These are somewhat similar to flux qubits but use a variant design. They are based on the phase difference across a Josephson junction and typically operate in a regime where the junction is biased in a way that it‚Äôs sensitive to the phase.</p>

<p>SQUID isn‚Äôt a qubit in the conventional sense but rather a superconducting device that can detect extremely small changes in magnetic fields. They operate based on the principles of quantum interference in superconducting materials. However, SQUID devices have been used in the design of certain types of superconducting qubits to enhance tunability or readout mechanisms. In the context of qubits, a SQUID loop (a loop with one or two Josephson junctions) can be used to create a tunable barrier or inductance which can influence the qubit behavior.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>3D Superconducting Qubits:</strong> Leveraging a three-dimensional design.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3D superconducting qubits are a variant of the transmon design. Unlike planar qubits which are fabricated on flat substrates, 3D qubits involve a 3-dimensional cavity where the qubit is placed. The advantage of this design is that the qubit is better isolated from its environment, leading to longer coherence times. These cavities are typically made of aluminum, and the qubit can be viewed as a non-linear resonator inside this cavity. The 3D design offers better protection against certain types of noise and decoherence mechanisms that plague the 2D counterparts.</p>

<section id="cat-qubits">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13"><span class="section-number">1.21.1.5. </span>Cat Qubits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cat-qubits" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>Based on Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat paradox.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Cat Qubits:</strong>
Cat qubits are named after the famous thought experiment by Schr√∂dinger known as ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat.‚Äù The thought experiment postulates a cat that is in a superposition of being both alive and dead simultaneously. Similarly, a cat qubit is in a superposition of two coherent states. These states are macroscopically distinct, making the cat qubit a type of ‚Äúmacroscopic quantum‚Äù system. Cat qubits can be realized in superconducting circuits using Josephson junctions and resonators, where the qubit states are superpositions of large photon number states in the resonator. One of the advantages of cat qubits is their potential resilience to certain types of errors, but they also come with challenges in preparation, control, and readout.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these superconducting qubit technologies presents its own sets of advantages and challenges, with ongoing research focusing on improving coherence times, gate fidelities, and scalability, all while reducing error rates. The goal is to achieve a robust and scalable quantum computer that can outperform classical counterparts in meaningful tasks</p>

<section id="trapped-particles">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14"><span class="section-number">1.21.2. </span>Trapped Particles</a><a class="headerlink" href="#trapped-particles" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Trapped particles offer another avenue for quantum computation, distinct from the solid-state devices like superconductors. These systems exploit the quantum nature of individual atoms or ions, using various trapping and cooling techniques. Let‚Äôs delve into each category:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Trapped Ions:</strong> Using electromagnetic fields to trap ions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neutral Atom Qubits:</strong> Trapping neutral atoms with optical tweezers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rydberg Atoms:</strong> Atoms excited to a high-energy Rydberg state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cold Atom Qubits:</strong> Atoms cooled to near absolute zero temperatures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trapped Ions:</strong>
Trapped ion quantum computing is one of the pioneering methods in quantum computation. It involves manipulating individucal ions (charged atoms) using electromagnetic fields.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ion Trapping: At the heart of this approach is the ion trap - a device that can confine ions in a small region of space using electromagnetic fields. Two main types of traps are used: linear Paul traps and Penning traps.</p>
<p>Quantum Gates with Ions: Once ions are trapped, laser beams are used to initialize, manipulate, and read out the quantum state of the ions. Two-qubit quantum gates are achieved by harnessing the Coulomb interaction between ions, which allows quantum information to be transferred between them.</p>
<p>Advantages &amp; Challenges: Trapped ions boast long coherence times, high-fidelity gate operations, and the ability to scale by interconnecting multiple traps. However, challenges include mitigating unwanted heating and ensuring precise control of the lasers and magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Companies like IonQ and Honeywell are at the forefront of developing trapped ion quantum computers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Neutral Atom Qubits:
Unlike ions, neutral atoms don‚Äôt have an electric charge. This makes them immune to certain types of noise but presents unique challenges in trapping and manipulation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Optical Tweezers: These are focused laser beams that can trap and move individual neutral atoms. Using arrays of these tweezers, one can arrange neutral atoms in specific configurations, enabling the precise control necessary for quantum computation.</p>
<p>Quantum Gates with Neutral Atoms: Two-qubit gates can be achieved by inducing controlled interactions between the neutral atoms, often using additional laser pulses.</p>
<p>Advantages &amp; Challenges: Neutral atoms have potential scalability advantages because large arrays of optical tweezers can be generated using spatial light modulators. However, challenges involve ensuring that these atoms remain in their traps and mitigating decoherence mechanisms.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Rydberg Atoms:
Rydberg atoms are neutral atoms that have one or more electrons excited to a very high-energy state. These atoms exhibit exaggerated quantum properties and can interact with each other over relatively large distances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating Rydberg Atoms: A neutral atom (e.g., rubidium) is excited using lasers to a high-energy state where one of its electrons orbits far from the nucleus.</p>
<p>Rydberg Blockade: When two Rydberg atoms come close together, their interactions prevent a third atom nearby from being excited to a Rydberg state. This phenomenon can be used to mediate interactions between qubits.</p>
<p>Advantages &amp; Challenges: The strong interactions between Rydberg atoms allow for rapid quantum gate operations. However, these same interactions can lead to unwanted noise and decoherence, requiring careful control.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cold Atom Qubits:
Cold atom quantum computing exploits the quantum behavior of atoms cooled to near absolute zero temperatures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Laser Cooling: Techniques like Doppler cooling and evaporative cooling are used to cool down a cloud of neutral atoms to temperatures just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.</p>
<p>Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC): At these ultra-low temperatures, atoms can form a new state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate, where they behave as a single quantum entity.</p>
<p>Quantum Gates with Cold Atoms: Interactions within the BEC, or between cold atoms, can be harnessed for quantum computation. This can involve using the collective behavior of atoms in the BEC or isolating individual atoms for qubit operations.</p>
<p>Advantages &amp; Challenges: Cold atoms can have long coherence times and are isolated from many types of environmental noise. However, ensuring precise control, maintaining the ultra-cold temperatures, and achieving reliable quantum gates remain challenges.</p>
<p>Each of these trapped particle systems brings unique advantages to the table, with different challenges to overcome. While trapped ions are the most mature of these technologies, research in neutral and Rydberg atoms has shown significant promise and continues to progress rapidly.</p>

<p>Superconducting qubits are among the most prominent and mature technologies in the realm of quantum computing. Let‚Äôs dive deep into each of the categories you‚Äôve listed:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Superconducting Qubits:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Basic Superconducting Qubits:
Superconducting qubits leverage the quantum behavior of superconducting circuits. These are electrical circuits made of superconducting materials that can carry an electric current without resistance when cooled to very low temperatures. The quantum behavior arises when these circuits are reduced to very small sizes, making them sensitive to quantum effects. A few of the primary types include:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Transmon Qubits: An evolution of the Cooper pair box qubit, the transmon has been designed to be less sensitive to charge noise, which was a limitation in earlier designs. It is one of the most widely used superconducting qubits due to its relatively long coherence times and ease of fabrication. The qubit state is determined by the number of Cooper pairs that have tunneled across a Josephson junction.</p>
<p>Flux Qubits: These qubits utilize the magnetic flux threading a superconducting loop, which contains one or more Josephson junctions. The two states of the qubit (often labeled as |0‚ü© and |1‚ü©) correspond to the clockwise and counter-clockwise circulating current states. They are sensitive to magnetic noise but can be designed to be less sensitive to charge noise.</p>
<p>Phase Qubits: These are somewhat similar to flux qubits but use a variant design. They are based on the phase difference across a Josephson junction and typically operate in a regime where the junction is biased in a way that it‚Äôs sensitive to the phase.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) Qubits:
SQUID isn‚Äôt a qubit in the conventional sense but rather a superconducting device that can detect extremely small changes in magnetic fields. They operate based on the principles of quantum interference in superconducting materials. However, SQUID devices have been used in the design of certain types of superconducting qubits to enhance tunability or readout mechanisms. In the context of qubits, a SQUID loop (a loop with one or two Josephson junctions) can be used to create a tunable barrier or inductance which can influence the qubit behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>3D Superconducting Qubits:
3D superconducting qubits are a variant of the transmon design. Unlike planar qubits which are fabricated on flat substrates, 3D qubits involve a 3-dimensional cavity where the qubit is placed. The advantage of this design is that the qubit is better isolated from its environment, leading to longer coherence times. These cavities are typically made of aluminum, and the qubit can be viewed as a non-linear resonator inside this cavity. The 3D design offers better protection against certain types of noise and decoherence mechanisms that plague the 2D counterparts.</p></li>
<li><p>Cat Qubits:
Cat qubits are named after the famous thought experiment by Schr√∂dinger known as ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat.‚Äù The thought experiment postulates a cat that is in a superposition of being both alive and dead simultaneously. Similarly, a cat qubit is in a superposition of two coherent states. These states are macroscopically distinct, making the cat qubit a type of ‚Äúmacroscopic quantum‚Äù system. Cat qubits can be realized in superconducting circuits using Josephson junctions and resonators, where the qubit states are superpositions of large photon number states in the resonator. One of the advantages of cat qubits is their potential resilience to certain types of errors, but they also come with challenges in preparation, control, and readout.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these superconducting qubit technologies presents its own sets of advantages and challenges, with ongoing research focusing on improving coherence times, gate fidelities, and scalability, all while reducing error rates. The goal is to achieve a robust and scalable quantum computer that can outperform classical counterparts in meaningful tasks.
Let‚Äôs try to compile a comprehensive list of type of quantum computers. Quantum computing is a vast field, and while some qubit implementations are more mature and well-researched, others are in their infancy or theoretical stages. Here‚Äôs an exhaustive list of qubit types and the various platforms being considered or researched for quantum computing:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Superconducting Qubits: Microfabricated circuits that exhibit quantum mechanical behavior when cooled.</p></li>
<li><p>Trapped Ions: Individual ions trapped using electromagnetic fields, manipulated with lasers.</p></li>
<li><p>Quantum Dots: Semiconductor-based qubits, with quantum information stored in the spin state of an electron.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Photonic Qubits: Quantum information encoded in properties of photons, such as polarization.</p>
<p>Topological Qubits: Based on braiding non-abelian anyons in two-dimensional systems.</p>
<p>NV (Nitrogen-Vacancy) Centers in Diamond: Quantum information stored in the spin states of electrons in diamond‚Äôs NV centers.</p>
<p>Silicon Qubits: Qubits using phosphorus-doped silicon or other silicon-based mechanisms.</p>
<p>Rydberg Atoms: Atoms in a high-energy state that exhibit strong interactions.</p>
<p>Cold Atoms in Optical Lattices: Ultra-cold neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices.</p>
<p>Majorana Fermions: Quasi-particles used to create topological qubits.</p>
<p>Ferroelectric Qubits: Based on the electric dipole moments in ferroelectric materials.</p>
<p>Spin Qubits: Qubits based on the intrinsic angular momentum of particles.</p>
<p>Bosonic Qubits: Using states of a bosonic mode, such as photon number states in a cavity.</p>
<p>Mechanical Oscillators: Quantum states of macroscopic mechanical oscillators.</p>
<p>Quantum Dot Hybrid Qubit: A combination of the spin and charge qubits in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>
<p>Molecular Magnets: Molecules that can retain quantum information in their magnetic states.</p>
<p>Endohedral Fullerenes: Molecules with atoms trapped inside fullerene cages.</p>
<p>Quantum Acoustic Resonators: Mechanical systems where quantum states of sound (phonons) can be used.</p>
<p>Quantum Annealers: Qubits made of superconducting materials, used in machines like those by D-Wave.</p>
<p>Nuclear Electric Resonance (NER) Qubits: Using the interaction of the electric quadrupole moment of a nucleus with an electric field gradient.</p>
<p>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Qubits: Based on the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei.</p>
<p>Quantum Computing with Solitons: Using solitons as carriers of quantum information.</p>
<p>2D Materials Beyond Graphene: Materials like transition metal dichalcogenides researched for potential quantum properties.</p>
<p>Hybrid Systems: Combining different quantum systems to leverage the advantages of each.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs important to note that while all of these methods are being explored, not all are at the same level of maturity or feasibility. Some are still mostly theoretical, while others have seen significant experimental progress. The eventual ‚Äúwinning‚Äù technology, or combination of technologies, will be the one(s) that can best balance issues of coherence, error rates, scalability, and manufacturability.</p>

<p>Constructing quantum computers is an extremely daunting task. In the sections that follow, we will discuss the various components of a quantum computer and explain how we can build one by integrating different technologies that interact with the machine.</p>
<p>First, we will give an overview of the entire system and briefly touch upon all layers. Over the subsequent 4-6 chapters, we will delve deeper into the quantum chip (qubits) layer.</p>
<p>Each qubit necessitates the use of a specific material. These materials must contain particles suitable for creating the qubits while remaining uncontaminated by other particles. As a result, it is critical to ‚Äògrow‚Äô these required materials.</p>
<p>To fully grasp the concepts presented herein, we will need certain mathematical tools. The mathematical basics will be explained in the chapters on Ket notation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the ‚Äòbuilding blocks‚Äô of a quantum computer include components such as <em>memory</em>, <em>bus interconnect</em>, and <em>processor chips</em>. Peripheral devices like keyboards or screens are essential for interacting with the machine.</p>
<p>In the following segments, we will discuss the broader aspects of a quantum computer: from programming it to interpreting the results. The first term we want to emphasize is <em>compute</em>. In reality, we are not merely building a quantum computer; we are developing a quantum accelerator. Specifically, we are creating a computational device that can be connected to a classical processor, which will then provide the performance required for various applications that are beyond the reach of classical computing. The concept of a heterogeneous multicore architecture offers a global view of our current understanding in this domain.</p>

<p>Heterogeneous because we have different kind of accelerator technologies. We have an</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We have</p></li>
<li><p>Graphic Programming Unit GPU‚Äôs. These are the vector processors we are using to produce graphics computation.</p></li>
<li><p>The third alternative accelerator technology will be a quantum co-processor which has the quantum properties that will provide a substantial increase in the compute power. This is basically what we see.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That also means that when you write any application, you will most likely end up using different kinds of accelerators including the FPGA, the GPU and also the quantum accelerator and therefore your application has to be compiled for four different instruction sets; namely, your</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Intel processor for instance on the classical machine, your</p></li>
<li><p>FPGA instruction set, the</p></li>
<li><p>GPU instruction set, and also the</p></li>
<li><p>quantum instruction set.</p></li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is very important to understand, so whatever we are going to discuss in the following talks is only going to focus on the quantum accelerator device or the application processes that we need classically as well as quantumly to be provided</p>
<p>Whenever we talk about a computer, classically we have divided that in different layers; the lowest layer is always let‚Äôs say the hardware, the</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>chip that has been designed. It is never a single chip or a single processor.</p></li>
<li><p>(Quantum to Classical) No, it has memory, it has interconnections, so a bus that allows the processor to communicate with the memory to retrieve instructions and to retrieve or produce the data. And then it goes up to the</p></li>
<li><p>Microarchitecture that we need, up to the application level. We will now go in detail on each of those layers in a quantum context. Because we are basically adopting the same kind of layer view of what a quantum accelerator or a quantum computer would be, and we simply put the Q of quantum in front of every layer. And that is our research and working program. The highest level is the 7 (4) quantum algorithm that we know of. We don‚Äôt even know yet what they will be. We have examples such as factorization that is used in cryptography in securing communication between machines.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But quantum algorithms can as well be designing a new molecule for personalized medicine. It can be that you might want to have a climate module that you want to run on your quantum accelerator that take all kind of mechanisms into account that we currently are unable to compute or even model on a classical machine. So that is the quantum algorithm layer, and that is where the biggest opportunity lies worldwide. Where many companies and organizations can actually start developing their own quantum application. Because every company or every end-user can think of how they can use that computational aspects of such a device.</p>
<p>One layer lower is that when you have an application that you need to program. You do that classically again. You have a programming language such as C++, Fortran, Cobol or any language that you can think of. Those languages can produce the code for a classical processor. But we also have to develop our own quantum language for the quantum accelerator. There are a couple of languages that have been developed so far. There is ScaffCC, and ProjectQ. And here at QuTech we are developing our own programming language called OpenQL, which is inspired by OpenCL, which is a language developed for GPU programming. We are now shifting it to the quantum infrastructure, so making the changes to that language. So that is the programming language layer.</p>
<p>For every programming language we need a compiler. A compiler takes the input of your algorithmic logic and compiles it into a lower level language that is classically called an assembly language. Again here we are working on a quantum assembly language which we call QASM, which was originally developed for a book ‚ÄòQuantum computation and information‚Äô by Nielsen and Chuang. To generate the figures in their book of the quantum circuits.</p>
<p>We just expanded that language into a full-fledged quantum assembly that is being generated by our OpenQL compiler, which is the programming language that we also developed. So that you can express your quantum logic in such a way. We are internationally collaborating with other partners working on similar things such that we standardize this quantum assembly language. Because for now everybody has its own local version, and that is not very good that everybody has his own variation, but if we all agree that this is what we assume to be QASM, then progress will come much faster.</p>
<p>The next layer is quantum arithmetic‚Äôs because the mathematics of what you need to do is completely different than classically. The quantum gates operate quite differently, that‚Äôs why you need to develop the quantum arithmetic; how to do a quantum operation. I will not say anything about run-time, which is another part that we need in a quantum accelerator. Because we will need it, but what kind of functionality it should have is a bit unclear right now. That is where there is the tension between the compiler development because we still can develop a lot of things in the compiler and maybe at a later stage we will develop that in a run-time support.</p>
<p>All of this QASM basically maps very well one on one with the quantum instruction set. This quantum instruction set basically describes what the operations are that your quantum device is capable of executing. That is why we have to think of what these instructions are. We know that classically we use an assignment like A = B + C. We should be able to do something similar in a quantum device. But it is not as simple as retrieving data from a memory location and perform the addition and writing back the result, because in quantum we use qubits.</p>
<p>A qubit is a quantum bit. Classically, we reason in terms of bits, zeros and ones. And as you know we are now using qubits, quantum bits. And they can be also zero or one, but they can also be zero and one at the same time. And that is the famous superposition that we are exploiting in a quantum device. We can also combine two qubits so we don‚Äôt have two different states but we have a combination of those states; namely 4 states at the same time.</p>
<p>we have 2^3 = 8 states. Now what is very nice about quantum is that the quantum mechanics gives us parallelism for free. Because I can apply quantum gates on those 2^n different states. You will come to understand in the upcoming lectures that nothing really comes for free. There is still a lot of challenges that need to be resolved. But that is ultimately the big challenge and the big opportunity that quantum offers. That is why you have to understand what this instruction set is and the corresponding architecture should be. And that immediately brings us to the layer of the micro-architecture.</p>
<p>Just like any classical processors we have also a quantum micro architecture for my quantum device, which contains the processor, the memory and also the interconnects of how the processor will communicate with the qubits. It has local registers in the processor and an ALU, an arithmetic logical unit so that it can compute logical and arithmetical operations, and write back the result to memory so that the user gets an idea of what the algorithm has computed as a result.</p>
<p>So again here in the quantum case we have a micro-architecture which has a similar kind of functionality. And that is the one we are also currently implementing in a real device that already controls a number of the physical qubits; a superconducting as well as a spin qubit that we are developing at QuTech. For now we are working on a 17 qubit micro-architecture, so that in principle we can go up to 2^17 parallel executions on the combination of those 17 qubits.</p>
<p>A layer lower is the quantum to classical layer. Because whatever you perform on the quantum level is always an analog phenomenon. Now you say; ‚Äúanalog? I thought we were building a computer? Which should be digital‚Ä¶‚Äù. Well, everything up to the micro-architecture is clearly digital, but ultimately what you send down to the quantum chip is for example a microwave, it can be other things, but let‚Äôs say it is a microwave and we control an individual electron at the atomic level. The individual electron is important to understand. So if I have 17 qubits, I basically have 17 electrons, not hundred thousands, not millions, but 17. And there are ways to combine those 17 electrons and their spins in the way that they interact and move that indicates that they are doing a particular calculation. So that means that this layer is necessary for translating all of the logical steps that you need to do in your algorithm into the appropriate microwave or the physical signal that you want to send to this electron and to the qubit.</p>
<p>And then ultimately it enters into the quantum chip. Which consists of these qubits which are connected to each other. And then we hope of course that we get a meaningful result. Now it is never the less important to understand for a quantum accelerator for any computational device is that it is a non-deterministic way of computing. That means that it is not like in a classical machine that you run a thousand times exactly the same algorithm and you will get a thousand times exactly the same result. Quantumly this is absolutely not true, because when you want to read out the result several things happen. The most important is that any entangled superposition that exists, actually is going to get destroyed. So if I have for example 2^17 possibilities, I am only going to get one of those possibilities back as a result. And all the others will disappear.</p>
<p>And that is why you maybe have to do a computation 10 times, maybe 100 times, we don‚Äôt even know how many times we need to do that. And then you can make a histogram of what has been computed, and the readout that has the highest frequency of occurrence has a high probability of being read out by our micro-architecture and that is what we can report back to the end user. So that is something that you should not forget. A quantum device is a very powerful device, it gives massive parallelism in principle. But we need multiple runs and average out what those calculations of those results are. And the one with the highest frequency is the most likely result of your quantum device.</p>

<p>When N classical bits are read out after a computation they can be found in one of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{N}\)</span> different states (e.g. if you read out 2 classical bits from your computer‚Äôs memory you will find them to be 00, 01, 10, or 11). When N qubits are read out after a computation they can also be found in one of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{N}\)</span> different states, just like classical bits. Where, then, does the advantage of using a quantum accelerator for some tasks come from?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There is no advantage to using a quantum accelerator.</p></li>

<p>Quantum computers are supposed to be a lot faster than classical computers for certain computations. We will soon dig into it, including what we mean by ‚Äòfast‚Äô and why quantum algorithms can have these properties. It is good to understand that by ‚Äòfast‚Äô we don‚Äôt mean ‚Äòtwice as fast‚Äô or even ‚Äò100 times as fast‚Äô. With the quantum speedup, we mean the difference between a month and the lifetime of the universe. So, computations that are nowhere feasible on a classical computer, suddenly become so on a quantum computer.</p>
<p>It is also good to think about whether quantum algorithms can do other things better.</p>

<h1><span class="section-number">1.22. </span>Quantum materials<a class="headerlink" href="#quantum-materials" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>Quantum materials are an essential feature if one would like to build a quantum computer or use the quantum internet. On a daily basis, Giordano Scappucci is working on optimizing quantum materials at QuTech. He will introduce you to this field of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics describes how atoms bind and electrons interact at a fundamental level. Naively speaking, all materials are quantum because all matter, in the end, must be explained by quantum mechanics. For example, our body is largely made up of water. In water, chemical reactions bind hydrogen and oxygen atoms together. Although this can be explained by quantum mechanics, we usually don‚Äôt think about water in these terms, and a high-school-level chemistry description does the job. This is, because we can often approximate the quantum behaviour in materials by a classical description. It turns out that a classical description is in fact suitable for most of the phenomena that we experience in the macroscopic world around us.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, to fully understand the behaviour of certain materials, it is necessary to keep quantum in view: there is no classical explanation to help our understanding. A feature of the broad category of Quantum Materials is that their behaviour is generally rooted in the quantum world. And while behaviours observed in quantum materials cover a wide spectrum, there are some common features that recur.</p>
<p>For example, many quantum materials derive their properties from reduced dimensionality. Electrons trapped in 2, 1, or 0 dimensions have different characteristics than electrons in 3D. Emergence is another recurring theme across quantum materials. Phenomena emerge due to the collective behaviour of original constituents.</p>
<p>In superconductor materials, the interaction between electrons, mediated by vibrations of the crystal lattice, creates the so-called Cooper pairs. Differently from individual electrons, Cooper pairs can share the same quantum state. Superconductivity emerges from the concerted state of pairs that propagates without electrical resistance through the crystal. Certainly, you need quantum mechanics to understand this!</p>
<p>The first quantum revolution, with the development of quantum mechanics, provided a microscopic understanding of nature. It had a tremendous impact in our life. Once you understand the periodic table and electronic wave functions, you understand semiconductors and how transistors are built and work. We now carry around billions of transistors in our pockets to perform complex tasks. It is clear that we need the concept of the photon to understand the laser.</p>
<p>We are currently in the midst of a second quantum revolution, in which quantum matter is engineered to develop disruptive technologies beyond the reach of classical understanding. Quantum computing is the man on the moon goal of such second quantum revolution. By working in a fundamentally different way, quantum computers have the promise of solving complex problems that classical computers cannot handle.</p>
<p>Quantum materials provide the environment where qubits, the elemental unit of quantum information processing, are defined and live. Therefore, quantum materials are at the basis of a quantum computer. To have a working quantum computer you need to couple together many qubits, while maintaining their long coherence time. These requirements are often conflicting. Qubits that are hard to couple together have long coherence times, because they tend to be isolated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, systems that are easy to couple together tend to lose coherence quickly, because they can be perturbed easily by the environment. In all cases, the precision of the qubit materials is crucial to solve these two challenging requirements. And when we say ‚Äúprecision‚Äù, we mean precision in terms of: materials uniformity, chemical composition, and electrical properties.</p>
<p>Ultimately, to make the phenomenally large number of qubits necessary to build a quantum computer, we would like to use the same manufacturing techniques of the microelectronic industry. Chemical vapour deposition, or CVD, is an industrial process that uses high purity gases to make high quality materials, with desired physical and electronic properties. For example, by depositing layers of silicon and silicon-germanium, we can tune the lattice parameter of silicon to be larger than usual and match that one of silicon germanium. As a result, the electronic properties of such hetero-structure, which is made of different materials, make it possible to form a 2D electron gas at the interface between silicon and silicon-germanium.</p>
<p>Qubits can then be made by isolating with electric fields one electron spin at that interface. If you want to isolate one single electron spin and make it a qubit, you need to know the properties of the host material very well. Once we make our crystal into a silicon heterostructure, we usually break it, and have a close look at it from the side with a high-resolution electron microscope. We call this microscope a transmission electron microscope, or TEM. Its working principle is based on electronic diffraction, another quantum effect, of an electron beam passing through a thin piece of material.</p>
<p>The spatial resolution is so high that we are able to see atomic arrangements in the lattice. In addition, a TEM is capable of distinguishing different elements from each other by their atomic weight. Therefore, it is a useful tool to analyze materials composition. Light elements appear darker than heavy elements. This allows us to check precisely to what extent, the material we made matches our expectations. For example, you see here the perfect atomic arrangement of silicon and germanium atoms at the critical interface between silicon and silicon-germanium. The lattice spacing is exactly the same at both sides of the sharp interface, indicating that the CVD process successfully strained silicon to match the underlying silicon-germanium.</p>
<p>The fact that we are able to make crystals with such precision and very little imperfections, is a key asset to then make good qubits. Once we know how the material we made looks like, we usually study its electronic properties, by modifying them with external parameters. Temperature, electric fields, and magnetic fields are the few knobs that we turn in our labs to probe quantum materials. These studies provide useful feedback to make the material a better environment for the qubits.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the Si heterostructure mentioned earlier. If we cool it to the very low temperatures at which qubits usually operate, say below one degree above absolute zero, it would be insulating. However, we can make the material conducting by imposing a vertical electric field. The electric field forms a metallic channel at the interface between silicon and silicon-germanium, which is then populated by electrons. The higher the electric field, the more the electrons in the channel.</p>
<p>By studying how the electrical resistance of such channel responds to a magnetic field, we are able to measure the number of electrons in the channel and their mobility. The mobility tells us how fast electrons can travel in such channel, and is an indication of the disorder in the system. The higher the mobility, the lower the disorder, and there will be a better chance of fabricating many qubits with similar properties. Materials homogeneity is one requirement to scale up the number of qubits into a quantum computer. Think of the billions of transistors in your laptop, if they were all behaving differently, there would be no chance of having them to work for you. And while we are currently optimizing quantum materials to build a quantum computer, ultimately, the hope is that when such a machine will exist, one of the first uses will be to efficiently simulate quantum systems, fulfilling the vision put forward by Richard Feynmann more than 30 years ago. In turn, this will help us understand and build even more complex quantum materials with extraordinary properties that today we cannot even predict.</p>

<h1><span class="section-number">1.23. </span>Introduction to Ket notation<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-ket-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>Before we dive deeper into the different layers of a quantum computer, we first want to introduce you to ket notation. Ket notation is a specific quantum method used to perform operations and measurements and will introduce the basics of ket notation.</p>
<p>Note that this is a densely packed section and don‚Äôt expect to understand everything after the first viewing. Much more time is needed to grasp the basics of Ket notation, and we advice you to review the following passages. Please do not let this subject deter you from following further. It is crucially important to understand the basics, because that will be used in the continuation. This is a difficult topic!</p>
<p>Typo:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>$\mid \psi\rangle=\cos(\theta/2)|0\rangle+e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta/2)|1\rangle$</p></li>
<li><p>The highlited line should read: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle\langle0\mid0\rangle\otimes I|0\rangle+|0\rangle\langle0\mid1\rangle\otimes I|0\rangle+|1\rangle\langle1\mid0\rangle\otimes X|0\rangle+|1\rangle\langle1\mid1\rangle\otimes X|0\rangle)\end{array}\)</span>$</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We would like to control quantum degrees of freedom in order to implement quantum computing, among other goals that we have. To talk about these degrees of freedom, we‚Äôre going to use some notation that you might not be familiar with, but it‚Äôs all very close to linear algebra. You are likely already familiar with linear algebra, which has column vectors denoted with an arrow, or with boldface type.</p>
<p>Column &amp; row vectors: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{x}=\boldsymbol{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
10\\
11\\
12
\end{array}\right],\,\,\,\vec{y}^{T}=\boldsymbol{y}^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\end{array}\right]\)</span>$</p>
<p>It also has a transpose operation that maps column vectors to row vectors, and vice versa. We can calculate the inner product of two such vectors, either by transposing one of them and multiplying, or by writing the dot product explicitly. Either way, we get a scalar by taking the inner product of these two vectors.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\overrightarrow{y}^{T}\overrightarrow{x}=\boldsymbol{y}\cdot\boldsymbol{x}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
10\\
11\\
12
\end{array}\right]=68\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In addition, we can transform one vector into another using a matrix, which can be written using boldface type or a hat, your preference.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\
4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\
7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
10\\
11\\
12
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
66\\
167\\
266
\end{array}\right]\end{split}\]</div>
<p>There is a slightly different notation that we use for vectors and matrices in quantum computing, which we often call ket notation.</p>
<p>In ket notation, a quantum state is expressed using a column vector with complex coefficients. For example, we can express the state of a qubit, a two-level system, as a linear combination of two basis vectors, which we call 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Column vectors $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rightarrow kets:\mid\psi\rangle=\alpha\mid0\rangle+\beta\mid1\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{array}\right]\)</span>$</p>
<p>In a departure from regular linear algebra, there is a well-defined dual vector for each quantum state, called a bra, which we can obtain by taking the complex conjugate and the transpose of the ket vector.</p>
<p>Dual vectors $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{Bra:}\langle\psi\mid=\left[\alpha^{*}\beta^{*}\right]\)</span>$</p>
<p>This is important for calculating inner products, which we always do by multiplying the bra for one state by the ket of the other, forming a bra-ket.</p>
<p><strong>Inner products:</strong></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\equiv brackets \langle\psi\mid\phi\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{cc}\alpha^{*} &amp; \beta^{*}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}\gamma\\\delta\end{array}\right]=\alpha^{*}\gamma+\beta^{*}\delta\end{split}\]</div>
<p>A central feature of quantum mechanics is that, when we perform a measurement to determine whether a state is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>, for example, we get a random answer, and the probability of measuring a state to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> is given by the squared magnitude of its <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> coefficient.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mid0\rangle/\mid1\rangle$ meaurement yields $\mid0\rangle$ with probability $\mid\langle\psi\mid0\rangle\mid^{2}=\mid\alpha\mid^{2}\]</div>
<p>One consequence of this is that, since such a measurement on a qubit state must result in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>, these squared magnitudes must sum to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>, since they are probabilities. This is called Born‚Äôs rule and the constraint that the probabilities must sum to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>, is called normalization.</p>
<p>Normalization:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\langle\psi\mid\psi\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha^{*} &amp; \beta^{*}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{array}\right]=\mid\alpha\mid^{2}+\mid\beta\mid^{2}=1
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>We can also express qubit states in different bases. Consider the often-used plus-minus basis, which consists of the normalized sum and difference of the 0 and 1 ket vectors. Given a state expressed in the 0/1 basis, we can calculate the coefficients required to express the same state in the plus-minus basis, as I have done here.</p>
<p>States can be expressed in different bases:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mid\pm\rangle=\frac{\mid0\rangle\pm\mid1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\,\,\,\alpha\mid0\rangle+\beta\mid1\rangle=\left(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\mid+\rangle+\left(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\mid-\rangle\]</div>
<p>This leaves us with a small question: if any basis is just as good as any other, is there a basis that we should use as the default? Fortunately, the devices that we use to store and manipulate qubit states provide us with just such a default basis.</p>
<div class="sd-col sd-d-flex-row docutils">

</div>
<p>One such device, which we see quite frequently in quantum mechanics, is the harmonic oscillator, shown on the left. These devices are described by a Hamiltonian, which is a matrix that assigns an energy E_k to each of its eigenstates, or preferred basis states, psi_k.</p>
<p>Every device has a Hamiltonian:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>These states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mid\psi_{k}\rangle\)</span> are orthogonal:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>The logic gate is the smallest classical computing system, and all classical computations can be expressed as a large sequence of these gates. The quantum counterpart to a logic gate is a unitary matrix, which replaces the computational basis with a new basis that depends on the operation that we want to perform. Probabilistic measurements are also described by matrices, but these matrices are hermitian, so in ket notation, they are just weighted sums of these ket-bra terms, where the psi_k states form an orthonormal basis for the space.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.23.1.1. </span>Unitary operations<a class="headerlink" href="#unitary-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>That‚Äôs probably a lot to take in all at once, so let‚Äôs take a look at a few examples. Here, we have a unitary operation that exchanges states in the computational basis, which we call X, or the Pauli X if you‚Äôre already familiar with Pauli matrices.
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
X=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right]=\mid1\rangle\langle0\mid+\mid0\rangle\langle1\mid\,\,\,\,\,X\mid0\rangle=\mid1\rangle\,\,\,\,\,X\mid1\rangle=\mid0\rangle
\)</span>$</p>
<p>Here it is decomposed into ket-bra terms, and here‚Äôs what happens when we use it to transform one of the computational basis states. We just get the other state. 0 goes to 1, and 1 goes back to 0. Not so exciting. Now let‚Äôs take a look at a more interesting operation, the Hadamard gate, H.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; -1
\end{array}\right]=\mid+\rangle\langle0\mid+\mid-\rangle\langle1\mid\,\,\,\,\,H\mid0\rangle=\mid+\rangle\,\,\,\,\,H\mid1\rangle=\mid-\rangle
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>As you can see, this changes the basis from the 0/1 basis to the +/- basis that we discussed earlier. Put in a 0, get out a +, put in a 1, get out a -. There is another gate, called the phase gate, which only multiplies the one state by a factor of i, changing the basis in a very subtle way.
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
P=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; i
\end{array}\right]=\mid0\rangle\langle0\mid+i\mid1\rangle\langle1\mid\,\,\,\,\,P\mid0\rangle=\mid0\rangle\,\,\,\,\,P\mid1\rangle=\mid1\rangle
\)</span>$</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs take a look at a few measurement operators. In an interesting coincidence, the Pauli X shows up again, since it‚Äôs both unitary and hermitian, we can use it both as an operation and a measurement.</p>
<p>Hermitian observables:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
X=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right]=\mid+\rangle\langle+\mid-\mid-\rangle\langle-\mid\,\,\,\,\,\langle+\mid X\mid+\rangle=1\,\,\,\,\,\langle-\mid X\mid-\rangle=-1
\)</span>$</p>
<p>Here, we have decomposed it into its eigenbasis, so the ket-bra terms are different than before, and we can see that its output values are +/- 1. Here‚Äôs another matrix which is both unitary and hermitian, the pauli Z.
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
Z=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -1
\end{array}\right]=\mid0\rangle\langle0\mid-\mid1\rangle\langle1\mid\,\,\,\,\,\langle0\mid Z\mid0\rangle=1\,\,\,\,\,\langle1\mid Z\mid1\rangle=-1
\)</span>$</p>
<p>It returns the exact same values as X, just for states in the 0/1 basis instead of the +/- basis.</p>
<p>And finally we have the identity, which is also unitary and hermitian.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
I=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]=\begin{array}{ccc}
\mid0\rangle\langle0\mid &amp; - &amp; \mid1\rangle\langle1\mid\\
 &amp; or\\
\mid+\rangle\langle+\mid &amp; + &amp; \mid-\rangle\langle-\mid
\end{array}\,\,\,\,\,\langle\psi\mid I\mid\psi\rangle=1\,\,\,\text{for all}\mid\psi\rangle
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>We can note that the identity doesn‚Äôt change the basis at all, so that indeed it can be expressed in any basis. Also when used as a measurement operator, it always returns 1, no matter what state is input.</p>

<section id="the-bloch-sphere">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.23.1.2. </span>The Bloch Sphere<a class="headerlink" href="#the-bloch-sphere" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>Coefficient in polar co-ordinates:</p>
<p>normalization constrains qubits‚Äô states further</p>
<p>Now that we have a few examples done, I would like to focus a little on a useful geometric representation of qubit states, called the Bloch Sphere. To show how qubit states can be mapped to the surface of a sphere, let‚Äôs start by expressing the coefficients alpha and beta in polar co-ordinates.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
|\psi\rangle=r_{0}e^{i\phi_{0}}|0\rangle+r_{1}e^{i\left(\phi_{0}+\phi\right)}|1\rangle
\]</div>
<p>Next, we can note that we can get rid of the phase on the alpha coefficient, since a ket multiplied by a phase produces the same measurement results as the ket itself, for any potential experiment, so these are not different in any physical sense.</p>
<p>(global phases don‚Äôt matter??</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\mid\psi\rangle\mapsto e^{i\phi_{0}}\mid\psi\rangle
\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\langle\psi\mid A\mid\psi\rangle\mapsto\left\langle \psi\left|e^{-i\alpha}Ae^{i\alpha}\right|\psi\right\rangle =\langle\psi\mid A\mid\psi\rangle
\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\mid\psi\rangle=r_{0}\mid0\rangle+r_{1}e^{i\phi}\mid1\rangle
\]</div>
<p>This results in a simpler expression for the state, but it‚Äôs not yet as simple as it can be.</p>
<p>To get it even simpeler, we need to recall that these states have to be normalized, so the sum of the squares of the two radii involved has to be 1.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\langle\psi\mid\psi\rangle=r_{0}^{2}+r_{1}^{2}\equiv1
\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\therefore\mid\psi\rangle=\cos(\theta)|0\rangle+e^{i\varphi}\mathrm{sin}(\theta)|1\rangle
\]</div>
<p>This implies that we can express them as the cosine and sine of an angle theta, since cos(theta)^2 + sin(theta)^2 is always 1.</p>
<p>This family of angles theta and phi also describes the set of points on the surface of a sphere of unit radius in 3d space.</p>
<div class="sd-col sd-d-flex-row docutils">

</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\mid\psi\rangle=\cos(\theta)|0\rangle+e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta)|1\rangle$$ anti-parallel on the Bloch sphere\\We can see that, setting theta to 0, and phi to whatever we want (here it's 0), we get $cos(theta) = 1$, $sin(theta) = 0$, so the corresponding state is simply the $0$ basis state.\\$$\mid\theta=0,\phi=0\rangle=\mid0\rangle,|\theta=\pi,\phi=0\rangle=\mid1\rangle\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>If we set theta to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span> however, we get the 1 state regardless of the setting of phi. Likewise if we set theta to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(pi/2\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> to either <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span>, we get one of the states from the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+/-\)</span> basis on the equator of the sphere.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mid\theta=\pi/2,\phi=0\rangle=|+\rangle,|\theta=\pi/2,\phi=\pi\rangle = \mid -\rangle\]</div>
<p>Unitary operations, which change the basis we are working in, effect1ively rotate the sphere. For example, the Hadamard operation from earlier rotates the +/- states on the equator by 90 degrees until they‚Äôre at the poles. Also note that the states on opposite sides of the sphere are actually orthogonal, so this mapping does not preserve the angle between states, but it‚Äôs still useful for describing single-qubit states and operations.</p>
<p>Unitary operations rotate the sphere $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left\langle \psi\mid\psi^{\prime}\right\rangle =0\leftrightarrow\text{anti-parallel on the Bloch sphere}\)</span>$</p>
<p>But how do we describe multi-qubit states and operations? Specifically, how do we build them up from operations on smaller subsystems of a many-qubit state? To accomplish this, we use a different kind of matrix product, called the tensor product, or Kronecker product. To take the tensor product of two matrices A and B, we write out a block matrix where each block is equal to B times the appropriate element of A.</p>
<p>Multi-qubit states and operations: tensor (or Kronecker) products:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}A\otimes B=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
A_{0,0}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B\\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
A_{m-1,0}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B
\end{array}\right] Compatible with matrix-matrix product (B)(C\otimes D)=(AC)\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The upper left block is B times the upper left element of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the tensor product is that it‚Äôs compatible with the regular matrix product.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[(A\otimes B)(C\otimes D)=(AC)\otimes(BD)\]</div>
<p>That is to say if I take the matrix product of two tensor products, I get the same matrix as if I took the matrix products first, then evaluated the tensor product. This is also easier to understand if we take a look at a few examples.</p>

<p>Now that we have seen the basic formalism and notation, we‚Äôre ready to calculate the results of a small sequence of quantum operations, which prepares a Bell state. First, we introduce a two-qubit gate which cannot be written as a tensor product of one-qubit gates, the controlled not, or cnot for short.</p>

\end{split}\]</div>
<p>As we can see, it can be decomposed into a sum of two tensor products that says if the first qubit is in the zero state, do the identity, and if the first qubit is in the one state, perform an X on the second qubit. Here we see the Bell state, which we‚Äôre going to prepare using the cnot.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

1
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>We can write it out using either ket notation, or as a column vector.</p>

<section id="id3">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.24.2. </span>Example: Bell State Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Note that the Bell state, just like the cnot, cannot be written as a tensor product. The first step in preparing the Bell state is to perform a Hadamard operation on the first qubit, which has been initiliazed in the zero state. So we calculate the tensor product of the Hadamard with the identity, since we‚Äôre not going to do anything to the second qubit immediately.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
H\otimes I=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\

1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Now we‚Äôre ready to set up our sequence of operations. First, we prepare the state 00, then we apply the Hadamard, then the cnot. This results in a Bell state, which is written out here as a column vector.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\begin{array}{l}
\text{ CNOT }\times(H\otimes I)(|0\rangle\otimes|0\rangle)\\
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{llll}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\

\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{array}\right]
\end{array}
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Now this is the correct answer, but it was a little tedious to come to, and the matrices involved are a little large. 3x3 matrices are typically big enough for any phisicist, so 4x4 is overdoing it a little.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs try and do it the easy way, using some more ket notation. First, we use the compatibility of the Kronecker and regular products to show that the state we get from executing the Hadamard on the first qubit is simply +0, without having to use any matrices.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\begin{array}{l}
H\otimes I(\mid0\rangle\otimes\mid0\rangle)=\mid+\rangle|0\rangle=\mid+0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mid00\rangle+\mid10\rangle\end{array}
\]</div>
<p>Now, all we have to show is that the cnot will take our state, which is 00 + 10, to the 00 + 11 state that we‚Äôre after.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\Omega\rangle=CNOT\times\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\mid00\rangle+\mid10\rangle)\right)
\]</div>
<p>If we insert the decomposition of the cnot into tensor products that we saw earlier, we can see that the resulting state has coefficients proportional to these inner products of the 0 &amp; 1 states.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\mid0\rangle\langle0\mid0\rangle\otimes I\mid0\rangle+\mid0\rangle\langle0\mid1\rangle\otimes I\mid1\rangle\quad+\mid1\rangle\langle1\mid0\rangle\otimes X\mid0\rangle+\mid1\rangle\langle1\mid1\rangle\otimes X\mid0\rangle)
\]</div>
<p>Of course, the 0/1 basis is orthonormal, so the products 00 and 11 evaluate to 1, and the products 01 and 10 evaluate to 0, leaving us with two remaining terms.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mid00\rangle+\mid11\rangle\right)
\]</div>
<p>These terms are exactly the 00 and 11 terms that we were after. And that‚Äôs how ket notation van help us to describe the effects of operations and measurements on quantum states.</p>

<p>In the previous ket notation we discussed three ways to represent quantum states:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>column vectors with complex coefficients,</p></li>
<li><p>kets themselves and</p></li>
<li><p>the geometric representation,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>which uses the Bloch sphere. Each one of these has their own little advantages and disadvantages, which we are going to see in the course of these videos. First, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the advantages of ket notation. So here‚Äôs ket‚Ä¶notation. Is very nice for‚Ä¶sparse‚Ä¶states. That is to say: states‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶which don‚Äôt have that many non-zero entries in some bases. Take for example this state here, which I will call psi, along with most other states.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mid\psi\rangle=\frac{\mid00000\rangle+\mid11111\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\]</div>
<p>It has got two nonzero terms. There is a one over root two term for the component in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(00000\)</span> and a one over root two term for the all-ones as well. That would be very cumbersome to write out in terms of a full vector, because that would require <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^5\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(32\)</span> entries, but here you can do it very compactly. Now, if you don‚Äôt have a compact discription for the state like this, if you just have some arbitrary coefficients, it can be very painstaking and time-consuming to write out something like this.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\alpha\mid00\rangle+\beta\mid01\rangle+\gamma\mid10\rangle+\delta\mid11\rangle\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\otimes 01 + \gamma \otimes 10 + \delta \otimes 11\)</span>. Here you would be better of to use something more like a column vector. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\)</span>.</p>

<p>And in some other times, especially if you‚Äôre considering operations - transformations on the set of states ‚Äì it can be beneficial to consider the Bloch sphere, where you have the reference state zero, some other states one, plus, minus and like so‚Ä¶</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.25.1. </span>Synthesising rotations<a class="headerlink" href="#synthesising-rotations" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>In some setups, experimentalists can only rotate along two axes of the Bloch sphere. In this video Ben will show you an example of how you can use these two rotation axes to achieve rotations around a third axis. He will do it both in vector form and in the Bloch sphere representation. Which do you think is the most convenient?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs show an example of something that‚Äôs a little bit difficult to do when looking at the matrix based picture of quantum mechanics, but if we put everything on the Bloch sphere it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>In many experiments, experimentalists can only rotate along two axes of the Bloch sphere. That is the x-axis, which goes in this direction and the y-axis, which is going in this way.</p>
<p>Many algorithms rely on rotations around the z-axis, which is independent from these other two. And we would like to see how to synthesize the z-rotations out of the tools that we have available: x and y rotations.</p>
<p>Now, I happen to know the answer to this question and I can begin by writing down the matrices that describe the operations that we would like to do. So, here is z and I‚Äôll say this is z(theta). For those of you who are really in the know, this is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
e^{i*z*theta}. But if this doesn‚Äôt make sense to you, then this is just a diagonal matrix with Z(\theta)=e^{\frac{iZ\theta}{2}}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{\frac{i\theta}{2}} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; e^{-\frac{i\theta}{2}}
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
e^{-i*theta/2}
\]</div>
<p>on the diagonal, zeros off the diagonal. And we can see immediately that x and y rotations on their own aren‚Äôt going to give us this z-rotation.</p>
<p>So we can write down x theta and y theta, which are just rotations around these axes by angles theta.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E^{ix*theta/2}, e^{i*y*theta/2}\]</div>
<p>And this guy is equal to cosine of theta over two minus i <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) -i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\)</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
X(\theta)=e^{\frac{iX\theta}{2}}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) &amp; -i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\\
-i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) &amp; \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
E^{i*y*theta/2}
\]</div>
<p>is quite similar. Cosine theta over two, sine theta over two, minus sine theta over two, cosine theta over two. Now, there‚Äôs a product of these rotations. A y an x and a y, that will excecute one of these sets.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
Y(\theta)=e^{\frac{iY\theta}{2}}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) &amp; -\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\\
-\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) &amp; \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Lets look at those matrix rotations first. What I am going to do is set theta, well, equal to pi over two for a y rotation. And that‚Äôs going to give me one over root two, one one, minus one, one. Y theta equal to minus pi over 2 will give me operations that look like one, minus one, one, one. You might recognize these to be quite similar to the Hadamard matrix that changes from the computational basis to the plus minus basis, and that is by design.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
Y(\theta=\frac{\pi}{2})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
Y(\theta=-\frac{\pi}{2})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Now lets take a look at what happens if we sandwich an x rotations around theta with these two matrices, which we lovingly call y 90 and y -90. Because they are 90 degree rotations. So, we‚Äôre going to get a, well, y pi by 2 x theta y minus pi 2. Is equal to 1 over root two one, minus one, one,one, cosine theta over two, minus i sine theta over two, minus i sine theta over two, cosine of theta over two. Then we have another one over root two, one, minus one, one, one. We multiply these through. So, first off I can take these two factors of one over square root of two, make them a factor of a half. One minus one one one. Then if I multiply these here, I get cos theta over two plus I sine theta over two, because these two minus signs cancel. So that‚Äôs cos theta over two plus I sine theta over two.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
Y_{\frac{\pi}{2}}X_{\theta}Y_{-\frac{\pi}{2}} =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\cdot\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) &amp; -i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\\
-i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) &amp; \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})
\end{array}\right]\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]
 =\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\cdot\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})+i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) &amp; \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})-i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\\
-(\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})+i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})) &amp; \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})-i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})
\end{array}\right]
 =\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2\left(\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})+i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\right) &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 2?\left(\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})-i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\right)
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Here I‚Äôll get cosine theta over two minus I sine theta over two. Here I‚Äôll get minus cosine, minus I sine. So that‚Äôs minus I cosine theta plus I sine theta over two. And then here I‚Äôll get cosine minus I sine. So, cosine theta over two minus I sine theta over two. Continuing on with all this math I can notice that these two elements are equal and opposite. So If I take one and minus one, I‚Äôll get cosine plus I sine, minus negative cosine plus I sine. Which is simply two cosine theta over two plus I sine theta over two. Here I take a number and it‚Äôs opposite, I get zero. Here I can take these two numbers which are equal and add them. That gives me theta over two minus I sine theta over two. And if I take one and minus one and these two I get zero as well.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs a lot of matrix multiplication. Now, let‚Äôs also use Eulers identity. We know that this is equal to e^{i<em>theta/2} and that this is equal to e^{-i</em>Theta/2}.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}
e^{i\theta}=\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})+i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\\e^{-i\theta}=\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})-i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\\From arithmetic using complex numbers. And so we have managed to synthesize this z rotation around theta just by using x rotations and y rotations.\\\begin{split}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2e^{i\theta} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 2?e^{-i\theta}
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>So by using a little bit of ket notation and some trigonometric identities, we can show that we can obtain universal control using only the tools that are available to the experimentalists. This is nice because it means we don‚Äôt have to design new hardware. We can just put together operations that we already have in order to obtain universal control.</p>
<p>But this is not that simple as it could be. There is a far easier way to see this, which we can do using the Bloch sphere. The action of this sequence of unitary operations. Y 90, x around some angle theta and then y minus 90 can be expressed in terms of matrices. But it‚Äôs much easier to see using the Bloch sphere. If we write down the Bloch sphere with the x axis pointing out of the board, we can see the effect of a y 90, a rotation around 90 degrees of the y axis, is just turning the sphere sort of like a steering wheel, so that the x axis now faces down and the z axis is where the x axis used to be. If we now apply a rotation around the x axis, that is giving us a rotation around our old z axis. And once we have that done, all we have to do is reverse the y 90 with a y minus 90 to restore the orientation of our original axes, having picked up a phase on the z. And that‚Äôs how we can synthesize a diagonal unitary. e^{itheta/2}, e^{-i*theta/2} out of the operations to which the experimentalists have access. A little bit of notations saves you a lot of hardware design.</p>

<section id="state-decomposition">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.25.2. </span>State decomposition<a class="headerlink" href="#state-decomposition" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Often in quantum computing , it is necessary to express one state in terms of a basis of some other states. I am going to go ahead and call this state decomposition, although you can see it under a variety of names and usually it‚Äôs clear from the context that they mean expressing one state in terms of a basis that is more familiar or convenient to. Now the rule of state decomposition is that any state phi can be expressed as a sum over k terms, where each term consists of an inner product of phi - the trial state - with one of the basis states phi_k, and the states phi_k. Number times vector. And this is the same as decomposing a vector in a basis if you are already familiar with linear algebra.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\mid\phi\rangle=\sum_{k}\underbrace{\langle\psi_{k}\mid\phi}*{\text{number}}\mid\underbrace{\psi*{k}}_{\text{vector}}\rangle
\]</div>
<p>As an example of this, let‚Äôs take a look at a trial wave function of zero, and a basis which is the Hadamard basis, the plus minus basis, that we reviewed in the lecture. The sum over psi_k, phi, psi_k is then the inner product of plus and zero times plus and the inner product of minus and zero times minus. Now here I figured out those inner product. The inner product of plus zero is one over root two times the dot product of these two vectors, which is just one over root two. And the calculation for minus zero is very similar, there is a minus sign here, but it gets multiplied by zero, making no difference, and we end up with one over root two again. Therefore, zero can be decomposed as one over root two, plus + minus, just as the plus state can be decomposed as one over root two, zero + one.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}
\mid\phi\rangle=\mid0\rangle,\,\,\,\mid\psi_{0}\rangle=\mid+\rangle,\,\,\,\mid\psi_{1}\rangle=\mid-1\rangle\\\mid\phi\rangle=\sum_{k}\langle\psi_{k}\mid\phi\rangle\mid\psi_{k}\rangle=\langle+\mid0\rangle\mid+\rangle+\langle-\mid0\rangle\mid-\rangle\\\begin{split}\langle+\mid0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}

1 &amp; -1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{split}\\\therefore\mid0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mid+\rangle+\mid-\rangle\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}

<h2><span class="section-number">1.25.3. </span>Performing arbitrary measurements<a class="headerlink" href="#performing-arbitrary-measurements" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>It could be that your measurement device is only capable of measuring in one basis. Ket notations helps us to show that it will not be difficult to let this simple measurement device measure in any basis. In this example Ben will show you how this works.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to talk today about how a little bit of ket-notation can save us a big experimental headache, when it comes time to try measure a qubit in an arbitrary basis. First, we have to review a few of the important facts.</p>
<p>Arbitrary measutremnent</p>
<p>The conjugate transpose of a matrix or a vector is given by first taking the transpose of this 2-by-2 matrix that leaves the diagonal elements in the same place, and exchanges the elements being b and c here, but also taking the complex conjugate of each element in the matrix.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\mid fU=\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
a &amp; b\\
c &amp; d
\end{array}\right],\,\,\,U^{\dagger}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
a^{*} &amp; b^{*}\\
c^{*} &amp; d^{*}
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>A second important fact, which you can prove yourself using this definition, and I encourage you to do so, is that the dagger or complex conjugate transpose of U- psi (ket) is just the bra for psi times U-dagger. Now, that follows from linear algebra, but it is easy to check for yourself.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}
\langle U\mid\psi\rangle\rangle^{\dagger}=\langle\psi\mid U^{\dagger}\\\begin{split}\mid\psi\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{array}\right],\,\,\,\mid\psi_{\bot}\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\beta^{*}\\
-\alpha^{*}
\end{array}\right],
\end{split}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>There‚Äôs also another construction that I‚Äôd like to use, which is that for every state psi, there is another state which I call psi-perp(endicular), which consists of these coefficients. So, if psi is alpha-beta, psi-perp is the conjugate of beta and minus the conjugate of alpha. And these states are by construction orthogonal, which you can also see just by taking the inner product and seeing that it‚Äôs always zero regardless of what alpha and beta are.</p>
<p>And with those three ingredients, we can solve this question.</p>
<p>¬¥+ So, experimentalists usually measure a single operator: the Pauli-Z operator, that was perhaps discussed earlier. But we‚Äôd like to be able to measure in whatever basis we want.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\{\mid0\rangle,\mid1\rangle\rangle,\,\,\,\text{basis}(Z)}
\]</div>
<p>So that if we have a question: ‚ÄúIs this state this or that?‚Äù, we can answer it without having to restrict ourselves to the 0-1 basis. So, we have a two-step plan to solve this. First, we‚Äôre going to apply some operator U, and then we‚Äôre going to measure in the 0-1 basis.</p>
<p>+How to measure in other basis</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Apply U</p></li>
<li><p>Measure in {\mid0\rangle,\mid1\rangle\rangle</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if you‚Äôve got a controllable qubit, you can apply an operator U as you see fit, and as discussed in the statement of the question, we can measure in the 0-1 basis. We can measure the Z-operator. So, the expectation value of this measurement, if we first apply U on psi, that replaces psi with psi-U-dagger in the bra and U-psi in the ket, and then we take the familiar sandwich product to determine the expectation value of the operator, we end up with psi-U-dagger-Z-U-psi.</p>
<p>Expectation value;</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
 =\left(\langle\psi\mid U^{\dagger}\right)Z\left(U\mid\psi\rangle\right)
 =\langle\psi\mid\left(U^{\dagger}ZU\right)\mid\psi\rangle
\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
U^{\dagger}ZU=\underbrace{U^{\dagger}\mid0\rangle}*{\mid\psi\rangle}\underbrace{\langle0\mid U}*{\langle\psi\mid}-\underbrace{U^{\dagger}\mid1\rangle}*{\mid\psi*{\bot}\rangle}\underbrace{\langle1\mid U}*{\langle\psi*{\bot}\mid}
\]</div>
<p>So, it‚Äôs as if we had our original state psi, and instead of measuring Z, we measured U-dagger-Z-U. Now, U-dagger-Z-U we can write out like so. And if we label the state U-dagger-0 as psi, then U-dagger-Z-U is equal to psi-psi minus psi-perp-psi-perp. This is a measurement that will return 1 if the state is psi, and -1 if the state is psi-perp, giving us an arbitrary basis to measure in.</p>

<h1><span class="section-number">1.26. </span>A fact about maximally entangled states<a class="headerlink" href="#a-fact-about-maximally-entangled-states" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>Ket notation is not always the best approach to find an answer or solve an equation. Ben will give you an example about entangled states where it would be a lot of work to use ket notation.</p>
<p>Often when doing quantum information, ket-notation can fail you. This happens a lot when you have a densely packed vector full of a bunch of different coefficients and there‚Äôs no obvious structure. Now, hopefully when that happens to you, you‚Äôre only going to deal with a few qubits. Otherwise, you are going to writing out coefficients for a very long time.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mid\psi^{*}\psi\rangle+\mid\psi_{\bot}^{*}\psi_{\bot}\rangle\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mid00\rangle+\mid11\rangle\right)\qquad\text{always}
\]</div>
<p>Here, we can see a not too bad example with two qubits where we‚Äôre going to prove that for any maximally entangled state of the form psi-star-psi plus psi-perp-star-psi-perp, it‚Äôs always equal to the Bell state that‚Äôs fully correlated that we know and love: 1 over root 2 (times) 0-0 plus 1-1.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\begin{split}
\mid\psi\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{array}\right],\,\,\,\mid\psi^{*}\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha^{*}\\
\beta^{*}
\end{array}\right],\end{split}\\\begin{split}\mid\psi_{\bot}\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{array}\right],\,\,\,\mid\psi_{\bot}^{*}\rangle=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\beta\\
-\alpha
\end{array}\right],
\end{split}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>And this is regardless of what psi is. So, if we take an arbitrary wavevector psi which is two complex coefficients alpha and beta, we can define psi-star, which is just the complex conjugate of that state, which is also a valid state, psi-perp, which is some state which is orthogonal to psi, which I encourage you to check for yourself by taking the inner product, and psi-perp-star, which is the complex conjugate of the orthogonal state. And if we write out all of our tensor products using the formula that we learned earlier, we obtain a pair of densely packed vectors full of those coefficients, which would be very awkward in ket-notation.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mid\psi^{*}\psi\rangle+\mid\psi_{\bot}^{*}\psi_{\bot}\rangle\right) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha^{*}\alpha\\
\alpha^{*}\beta\\
\beta^{*}\alpha\\
\beta^{*}\beta
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\beta^{*}\beta\\
-\beta\alpha^{*}\\
-\alpha\beta^{*}\\
\alpha\alpha^{*}
\end{array}\right]\right]
 =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mid\alpha\mid^{2}+\mid\beta\mid^{2}\\
0\\
0\\
\mid\alpha\mid^{2}+\mid\beta\mid^{2}
\end{array}\right]\right]
 =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0\\
0\\
1
\end{array}\right]
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>But we have here alpha-star-alpha, alpha-star-beta, beta-star-alpha and beta-star-beta. And we‚Äôre going to add to that: beta-beta-star, minus beta-alpha-star, minus alpha-beta-star and alpha-alpha-star. Now, beta-star-beta plus alpha-alpha-star is just the magnitude of alpha squared plus the magnitude of beta squared, which is 1. And we see that same thing in the top term here, alpha-star-alpha plus beta-beta-star, that‚Äôs 1. And then these inner terms cancel. Because you have alpha-star-beta minus beta-alpha-star, that has just been flipped here. And a beta-star-alpha minus alpha-beta-star, if I flipped these two, it becomes obvious that they are equal and opposite, so they cancel. This implies for example, that for example if Alice and Bob share a Bell state, and Alice measure in a 0-1 basis, she can get a state 0 or 1 and she can tell that Bob has the same state. Now she measures instead in the basis psi-star psi-star-perp, she can tell that Bob has the state psi or psi-perp depending on her measurement result.</p>

<h1><span class="section-number">1.27. </span>Experimental and theoretical measurements<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-and-theoretical-measurements" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>In this section we will explain the difference between measurements that occur in a laboratory and measurements that are described in theory. What are the differences and how are those similar?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take this opportunity to clarify something that confuses a lot when first learning about quantum mechanics, which is the difference between measurements that occur in a laboratory and measurements that we describe in theory. And also point out hopefully the ways in which these things are similar. So, you may have already seen a picture like this one. But, in the laboratories we can measure some currents in nanoamperes, and if there‚Äôs a spin in the down state pointing parallel to the field, there will be no bump in the current. And if it‚Äôs in the up state, there will be a bump. And this is a large macroscopic classical signal that they can detect. And this relates to a measurement operator. You can imagine that we take the total area under this curve; the total amount of current, in the case that there‚Äôs no bump, and that corresponds to the spin down state. And the total current in the case that there is a bump will be slightly higher, and that corresponds to the spin up state. So, that real number: the amount of current times the projector on to the down state plus the total amount of current in the case that there is bump times the projector on to the up state gives us our measurement operator. Now, the important thing about these two signals being distinguishable, but there being a large difference between them, is that if they‚Äôre equal, we end up with some number times down-down plus some number which is identical, times up-up. So, the measurement operator becomes the identity, which doesn‚Äôt discern between the up and down states. So as useless is the measurement. But if these numbers are discernably different, then down-down and up-up receive different measurement outcomes, and out measurement operator is \mathbf{1}more like a Z, which is one we could use to accurately distinguish between the computational basis states in quantum computing.</p>

<p>2 qubit operations are operations that involve, as expected, 2 qubits. Just as 1 qubit operations they can be written in matrix form. However, since 2 qubits are now involved, these matrices are now 4\times4 unitaries. For the following 2 qubit operations, click the appropiate matrix that corresponds with the operation. - The 2 qubit operation that applies a bit flip on the second qubit, conditioned on the first qubit being in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mid1\rangle\)</span> state. So, a bit flip is applied to the second qubit if the first qubit is in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mid1\rangle\)</span> state, and no flip is applied if the first qubit is in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mid0\rangle\)</span> state. A bit flip (or X ) turns a 0 into a 1 and a 1 into a 0 . so</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}X(\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle)=\beta|0\rangle+\alpha|1\rangle$$.\\What we see in this question is a controlled bit flip, or a CNOT gate, with the first qubit as control qubit, and the second qubit as target qubit.

- The 2 qubit operation that applies a phase flip on the second qubit, conditioned on the first qubit being in the |-\rangle state. A phase flip (or Z ) is the equivelant of a bit flip. But in the Hadamard basis. It turns a + intoa - and a - into +. You could think of this as changing the sign of the |0\rangle component; Z(\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle)=\alpha|0\rangle-\beta|1\rangle. Here we ask for a controlled phase gate, or a CPHASE gate. But in a different basis; We only do a phase flip, if the first qubit is |-\rangle \fullmoon\qquad\\Explanation The first operation is exactly the CNOT. You should be able to recognize this one! The second operation looks very much like the CPHASE, but it has one important difference: the condition is on the |-\rangle state and not on the |1\rangle state. The Hadamard transform these to eachother, so that we need the CPHASE by that matrix that transforms the first qubit, and does nothing on the second qubit: H\otimes I. We need to map, perform the CPHASE, and map back, so the total operation becomes: (H\otimes I)CPHASE(H\otimes I). In terms of 4\times4 matrices this is\\\begin{split}$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}

### Question 4: Unitaries, or mapping one basis to another

Let the basis

$$\{\mathbf{v}\} be the set of vectors \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
\cos\theta_{1}\\
\sin\theta_{1}
\end{array}\right],\left[\begin{array}{c}
-\sin\theta_{1}\\
\cos\theta_{1}
\end{array}\right]\right\}  
$$

And let the basis

$$\{\mathbf{b}\} be the set of vectors \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c}
\cos\theta_{2}\\
\sin\theta_{2}
\end{array}\right],\left[\begin{array}{c}
-\sin\theta_{2}\\
\cos\theta_{2}
\end{array}\right]\right\}  
$$
Calculate the matrix that maps $\{\mathbf{b}\}$ to $\{\mathbf{v}\}$. To input the questions, fill every 4 entries in seperately below. Simplify answers as good as possible by using these identities.

$$
\begin{array}{|l|}

\sin\theta\cos\varphi=\frac{\sin(\theta+\varphi)+\sin(\theta-\varphi)}{2}\\
\cos\theta\sin\varphi=\frac{\sin(\theta+\varphi)-\sin(\theta-\varphi)}{2}\\
\tan\theta\tan\varphi=\frac{\cos(\theta-\varphi)-\cos(\theta+\varphi)}{\cos(\theta-\varphi)+\cos(\theta+\varphi)}\\
\hline \prod_{k=1}^{n}\cos\theta_{k}=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\sum_{e\in S}\cos\left(e_{1}\theta_{1}+\cdots+e_{n}\theta_{n}\right)\\
\text{ where }e=\left(e_{1},\cdots,e_{n}\right)\in S=\{1,-1\}^{n}\\
\prod_{k=1}^{n}\sin\theta_{k}=\frac{(-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor }}{2^{n}}\left\{ \sum_{e\in S}\cos\left(e_{1}\theta_{1}+\cdots+e_{n}\theta_{n}\right)\prod_{j=1}^{n}e_{j}\text{ if }n\right.\text{ is even, }
\\\hline \end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned} &amp; \text{ Sum-to-product }{}^{[28]}\\
 &amp; \sin\theta\pm\sin\varphi=2\sin\left(\frac{\theta\pm\varphi}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{\theta\mp\varphi}{2}\right)\\
 &amp; \cos\theta+\cos\varphi=2\cos\left(\frac{\theta+\varphi}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{\theta-\varphi}{2}\right)\\
 &amp; \cos\theta-\cos\varphi=-2\sin\left(\frac{\theta+\varphi}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\theta-\varphi}{2}\right)\\
 &amp; \tan\theta\pm\tan\varphi=\frac{\sin(\theta\pm\varphi)}{\cos\theta\cos\varphi}
\end{aligned}
$$

A nice video that explains transformations of bases can be found here. Fill in

$$\cos\theta_{1} as \cos\left(\right. theta_1) \cos\left(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\right)$$ as
$$\cos (theta_1 + theta_2), \cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2} as \cos\left(\right. theta_1)$$

$$\cos ($ theta_ 2$), \cos \theta_{1}+\cos \theta_{2}$$
as
$$\cos ($ theta_1 $+$ $\cos$ (theta_2)$$, etc. Also, answers provided in the most compact form: $$\sin \left(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\right)$$ or similar are preferred as others might raise problems in being detected as correct even if they are. Remember and use these identities:

$$\sin\left(\theta_{1}\pm\theta_{2}\right)=\sin\left(\theta_{1}\right)\cos\left(\theta_{2}\right)\pm\cos\left(\theta_{1}\right)\sin\left(\theta_{2}\right)$$

$$\cos\left(\theta_{1}\pm\theta_{2}\right)=\cos\left(\theta_{1}\right)\cos\left(\theta_{2}\right)\mp\sin\left(\theta_{1}\right)\sin\left(\theta_{2}\right)$$

```{admonition} Explanation
Hint (1 of 3): Since it is a mapping from one basis to another, the matrix should be unitary.

Hint (2 of 3): You can use a geometrical argument to solve this

Hint (3 of 3): The top left entry is the inner product between \boldsymbol{v}*{1}and \boldsymbol{b*{1}:}\langle\boldsymbol{v_{1}}\mid\boldsymbol{b_{1}}\rangle

The top left entry in the matrix is:

- [x] $cos(theta_{1}-theta_{2})$$

$$ cos(theta_1 - theta_2) or cos(theta_2 - theta_1) or cos(theta_1)cos(theta_2) + sin(theta_1)sin(theta_2) or cos(theta_1-theta_2) or cos(theta_2-theta_1) or cos(theta_1)cos(theta_2)+sin(theta_1)sin(theta_2) or cos(theta_2)cos(theta_1) + sin(theta_2)sin(theta_1) or cos(theta_2)cos(theta_1)+sin(theta_2)sin(theta_1)$$

The top right entry in the matrix is:

- [x] $sin(theta_{1}-theta_{2})$ 

$$ sin(theta_1 - theta_2) or sin(theta_2 - theta_1) or cos(theta_1)sin(theta_2) - sin(theta_1)cos(theta_2) or -sin(theta_1-theta_2) or sin(theta_2-theta_1)$$ or 
$$cos(theta_1)sin(theta_2)-sin(theta_1)cos(theta_2) or sin(theta_2)cos(theta_1)-cos(theta_2)sin(theta_1) or sin(theta_2)cos(theta_1) - cos(theta_2)sin(theta_1)$$

The bottom left entry in the matrix is:

- [x] sin(theta_{1}-theta_{2})

sin(theta_1 - theta_2) or -sin(theta_2 - theta_1) or sin(theta_1)cos(theta_2) - cos(theta_1)sin(theta_2) or sin(theta_1-theta_2) or -sin(theta_2-theta_1) or sin(theta_1)cos(theta_2)-cos(theta_1)sin(theta_2) or cos(theta_2)sin(theta_1) - sin(theta_2)cos(theta_1) or cos(theta_2)sin(theta_1)-sin(theta_2)cos(theta_1)

The bottom right entry in the matrix is:

- [x] cos(theta_{1}-theta_{2})

$$ cos(theta_1 - theta_2) or cos(theta_2 - theta_1) or cos(theta_1 - theta_2) or cos(theta_2 - theta_1) or cos(theta_2-theta_1) or cos(theta_1-theta_2)$$

**Explanation:** The inner product between \boldsymbol{v_{1}\,}\text{and}\,\boldsymbol{b_{1}}\rangleis cos(ùúÉ1)cos(ùúÉ2)+sin(ùúÉ1)sin(ùúÉ2). Using the identities in the link, this can be written as cos(ùúÉ1‚àíùúÉ2). The rest of the inner products can be calculated the same way. Note that the answer only depends on the difference between $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{1}$!
