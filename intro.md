```{admonition} About Us
$\mathbb{Q}\mid\mathcal{D}\partial\mathfrak{r}\imath\alpha\rangle$ is a quantum technology company, founded in 2019, with the vision of democratizing access to quantum computing. We aim to make quantum computing accessible and understandable to everyone, everywhere. We believe that quantum computing is the future and holds the key to solving some of the world's most complex problems. Our mission is to research, develop, and educate on quantum technology, driving innovation and understanding in the field. Our core values are the pillars of our organization, guiding every decision and strategy. In the subsequent sections, we'll detail each value and explain its significance.
