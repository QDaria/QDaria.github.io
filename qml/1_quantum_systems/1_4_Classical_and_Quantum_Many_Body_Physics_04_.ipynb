    "Quantum computers, which will be ideal, will only require knowledge of computer science. But the quantum computers that we have today require a bit of understanding of the underlying physics. So we have to go through a classical model of statistical mechanics, which is called the classical Ising model, to understand what happens in some quantum computers that we can use today. So let's start by introducing a spin system. A spin is a two-state system. So for instance, you can think of a magnet having north face pointing up or south face pointing up. And you know if you take two magnets and you approach them, then they want to antialign. So this will be their optimal energy configuration. So if you identify random variables with them-- for instance, this is some random variable sigma one, this is some random variable sigma two-- and you say that the north face pointing up is the value plus 1 and this is the value minus 1, then you can write down that the energy of this system is, say, sigma one times sigma two. And in this case, it's going to be minus 1, so we look for the lowest energy solution. And this is what nature naturally finds. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we add one more magnet, then that is also going to antialign with its nearest neighbor. So this is going to be plus 1 for some sigma three. So we can write another term here, which is sigma two times sigma three. And we can write it as a sum over nearest neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2}+\\sigma_{2}\\sigma_{3}=\\sum_{<i,j>}\\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So this notation stands for nearest neighbors. And we are going to have sigma i sigma j. This term describes the energy of this system and we want to minimize it, but nature naturally minimizes it. Now, let's make it a little bit more complicated and assume that there is some wall that you can control. So with this, you can change the strength of interaction between the individual pairs of magnet. In other words, you can change the coupling strength between them. So we model this by having some coefficient with each of the pairs of the interactions. Now to complicate it even more, we can add an external magnetic field below each and every one of these individual magnets, which in theory, can be a lot bigger than the interaction strength between the magnets. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2}+\\sigma_{2}\\sigma_{3}=\\sum_{<i,j>}J_{ij}\\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, each of these are north facing up. So now, if this magnetic field is strong enough, then it can flip, for instance, this magnet upside down. So there will be some frustration between these two, but the strength of this magnetic field will override this interaction. So we model this external field by adding one more term here, which is going to be the strength of that field-- Hi-- times the actual sigma i value-- the value of the random variable in that spot. \n",

    "\n",
    "So this is actually a very hard problem to solve for nature because what happens-- and if you look at the energy landscape of this problem, then what can happen is that for instance, the magnets naturally align, they flip, but they might get stuck in some local optimum. So it's possible that by overcoming this barrier, they would be able to attain a better configuration, which is the actual lowest energy solution. But since there isn't enough energy for the system to hop out from here, it's stuck in this local optimum. And this is exactly the same kind of problem that we see in computer science in certain NP-hard problems. So if you look at something that's called a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, it actually has a very similar form. Y\n",

    "you have binary variables $$x_{i}x_{j}$$, and you have some interaction strength between them $W_{ij}$. They have coefficients.

And on a classical computer, in the general case, this takes exponentially many evaluations to find the global optimum because you have the same problem. You would otherwise get stuck in some local optimum. So there is this very natural correspondence between what is computationally hard and what's physically difficult to solve. And just by convention, we typically put a minus sign here and we change this into a minus sign. So the actual coupling strengths are opposite sign to what I describe here. But apart from that, this describes the energy of the system. And the operator or what is equation that describes the energy of the system is called a Hamiltonian. \n",

So the quantum-mechanical form of the classical Ising model is exactly the same as what we have seen, except that we have operators here. Now all of these are sigma z operators acting on a particular qubit. But since this is now a large operator, what we want to do is calculate the expectation value of this, because we are interested in the energy of this system and not an operator. And when we were talking about measurements, we saw that if we sandwich the measurement operator with the bra from the left and the ket from the right, then we get a scalar value out of it.
