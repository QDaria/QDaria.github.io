    "# Evolution in Closed Systems\n",
    "We have covered what a quantum state is, and how we can pull out samples from a quantum state, and now it's time to look at how we do quantum a computation. In other words, how we evolve this probability distribution. So we started with closed systems, which means that evolution is going to be unitary. This is the idealized version of a quantum calculation. But before we actually explain what it means and what it implies, let's take a look at how we transform classical probability distributions. Stochastic vectors fulfill certain conditions,\n",

    "$$M\\boldsymbol{p}=\\boldsymbol{p}'$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where M is a stochastic matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "So after the transformation, whatever you get is still a stochastic vector. It's still a probability distribution. And in this case, this is a left stochastic matrix, which means that the columns of this matrix add up to 1. So when it comes to quantum states, we want to apply some operation on the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U\\mid\\psi\\rangle=\\mid\\psi'\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And whatever we get, we want to be sure that this is still a quantum state. So the matrix U that fulfills this condition has the probability that it's unitary. Unitary means that if you apply it's convex conjugate you get the identity. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$UU^{\\dagger}=I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means that the complex conjugate of the matrix is its actual inverse. It is also true if you apply the complex conjugate first and then the matrix itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$UU^{\\dagger}=U^{\\dagger}U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all that the operation has to fulfill. And as I mentioned, this is this idealized computation that the quantum computer executes. And it has some consequences. Obviously, it preserves the L2 norm. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Quantum states: \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal Quantum computers implement unitary operations. Some properties \n",

    "And it's also linear, since we are only applying matrix on a vector U. This becomes a little bit difficult when we want to apply nonlinear operations. For instance, we want to do some machine learning algorithm that's intrinsically nonlinear, then we have to resort to all sorts of approximations and tricks. Then the calculation is reversible. So that comes from this property. We can always invert this matrix U^{\\dagger}. So this is in stark contrast with what you see in digital computing, because in digital computing you actually lose information as you proceed in a calculation. For instance, if you apply an end operation, just by looking at the outcome of this end logical gate, you will not be able to tell what were the two initial bits that went into this gate. So you lose information. This cannot happen in this idealized quantum system. As an example, let's look at this operation which is also called the NOT gate or the X gate.Example: $$X=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "0 & 1\\\\\n",
    "1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",

    "0 & 1\\\\\n",
    "1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same as X. Now, if we apply this gate on the 0 ket, we can write out what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X\\mid0\\rangle=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "0 & 1\\\\\n",
    "1 & 0\n",

    "$$X\\mid1\\rangle=\\mid0\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you apply to a generic quantum state, which is a superposition of the two basis vectors, then since it's a linear it's going to distribute to the individual elements of the qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$X\\mid\\psi\\rangle=X(a_{0}\\mid0\\rangle+a_{1}\\mid1\\rangle)$$ So if you have x applied to the 0 ket, and then x applied to the 1 ket-- in other words, you just have A0 times the 1 ket and A1 times the 0 ket. \n",

    "SPEAKER: We talked about evolution in closed systems, which is exactly what a universal idealized quantum computer wants to achieve. Real quantum systems, however, are not closed systems. They are open systems. Which means that if you have a system of interest, for instance, your quantum processor, it actually is embedded in an environment or a thermal bath. And what happens is that your system interacts with this environment in a largely uncontrolled fashion. And since this interaction happens, the system's own evolution is no longer described as a unitary operation. It's described by a very different mathematical object. Technically speaking, it's a CPTP map, which stands for Completely Positive Trace Preserving map. But we are not going to work with this, we just have to keep this picture in mind that you have a system interacting with an environment which destroys the unitary nature of the evolution. So to get a sense of what is going on, let's talk about decoherence. \n",

    "\n",
    "where $$v\\in[0:1]$$ is visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "So we introduced density matrices. So when I take the density matrix of a pure state-- for instance, take the density matrix of the equal superposition of the 0 and the 1 ket $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\mid00\\rangle+\\mid11\\rangle\\right)$$.\n",

    "And we can mix it with random noise, which is just the identity matrix divided by the number of dimensions. So this would correspond to the maximally mixed state-- the classical uniform distribution. And we can control how much noise we have by tuning this parameter called invisibility between 0 and 1. So over at invisibility 1 we have the pure state, but the lower invisibility we mix in this maximal and mixed state. And the more we mix, the more the coherences vanish. And when we reach 0 visibility, we end up with a maximally mixed state. So the speed at which happens affects our quantum calculations. Because we want to finish the calculation before this system completely decoheres. \n",

    "This is sometimes called the T2 time, and it's one of the characteristics that you look at when you study how good a quantum computer is. Another way of looking at it is an equilibriation process. So this model is actually the exact same thing-- what happens to a cup of coffee. So if you take a cup of coffee and you remove the lid, then you will have a lot of interaction between the environment, in the room where you are in, and your coffee. So it's going to cool down and it is going to attain the temperature of the environment. So this is when it becomes in a thermal equilibrium with the environment. Once this happens, you are in a particular state. And for the quantum system, this is called the thermal state. And this is a very specific form. The configurations corresponding to certain energies follow a particular probability distribution, which is the Boltzmann distribution.\n",

If you have some finite temperature, then this is going to look something like this. So this is some finite temperature.

    "Another way to look at what happens to a quantum state in an open system is through equilibrium processes. Think of a cup of coffee: left alone, it will equilibrate with the environment, eventually reaching the temperature of the environment. This includes energy exchange. A quantum state does the same thing and the environment has a defined temperature, just like the environment of a cup of coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium state is called the thermal state. It has a very specific structure and we will revisit it, but for now, suffice to say that the energy of the samples pulled out of a thermal state follows a Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann -- also called Gibbs -- distribution is described as $P(E_i) = \\frac {e^{-E_{i}/T}}{\\sum _{j=1}^{M}{e^{-E_{j}/T}}}$, where $E_i$ is an energy, and $M$ is the total number of possible energy levels. Temperature enters the definition: the higher the temperature, the closer we are to the uniform distribution. In the infinite temperature limit, it recovers the uniform distribution. At high temperatures, all energy levels have an equal probability. In contrast, at zero temperature, the entire probability mass is concentrated on the lowest energy level, the ground state energy. To get a sense of this, let's plot the Boltzmann distribution with vastly different temperatures:"
