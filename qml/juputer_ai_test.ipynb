    "# Measurements revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous we introduced quantum states as a generalization of classical probabilities. But we left it open how to exactly extract a certain event with a certain probability. To formalize this, we have to introduce measurements. Prior to introducing measurements, we neet to introduce a bit more of the notation. Remembering that we introduced a quantum state as a column vector, which we write as a ket. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Bra-Ket Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a vertical bar, and an angle sign, an in-between we write the name of the vector or the variable. And in the simplest case, this is a two-level system, it's a qubit, so it can take-- it's a vector of two elements, and both elements are complex. Now, a complex number, in general, is written in this form. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Ket:}\\mid\\psi\\rangle=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "a_{0}\\\\\n",
    "a_{1}\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_{0}\t=x_{0}+iy_{0}$\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\n",
    "So for instance, $a_{0}$ is equal to $x_{0}$, which is a real number, plus the imaginary number times $y_0$. Now, there is something that we can do with complex numbers that we cannot do with real numbers-- we can take their conjugate. Which means that we flip the sign of the imaginary component. So with this conjugate we can introduce the complement of a ket. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bar{a_{0}}=x_{0}-iy_{0}$ Which is its conjugate transpose. So it's called a bra. And it's written as the mirror of the ket. So we start in an angle side from the other side, and then we write a name of the bra, and then a vertical sign. So this is equal to the complex conjugate transpose of the ket. This sign is called a dagger. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Bra:}\\langle\\psi\\mid=\\mid\\psi\\rangle^{\\dagger}=\\left[\\bar{a_{0}}\\bar{a_{1}}\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "And since this is a transpose, it's going to be a row vector. And each of the complex components is going to take its complex conjugate. So that's it. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Dot product\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can think of it as when we talk about stochastic vectors, we can also transpose them. But since we talk about real numbers, in the case of stochastic vectors, this complex component doesn't make any sense. Whereas here, we have to take care that we deal with complex numbers and there's something to get out of this. So for instance, with this notation it's very easy to write dot productions. So for instance, if we take the bra of some arbitrary state side, and we follow it up by a ket, that's going to be the product of a row vector with a column vector. In other words, it's going to be a dot product. \n",
    "\n",
    "It expands as the absolute value of $a_{0}$ squared plus the absolute value of $a_{1}$ squared. And we know that since the vector is normalized this is just 1. So there's just one particular way of writing the two norm-- by the square of the 2 norm of the quantum state. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle\\psi\\mid\\psi\\rangle=\\mid a_{0}\\mid^{2}+\\mid a_{1}\\mid^{2}=1=\\mid\\mid\\psi\\mid\\mid_{2}^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",

And as a matter of fact, if you look at this carefully, this is nothing else but the projection to this particular basis vector. So armed with this knowledge, we can, start talking about measurements. So the intuition is that the measurement is very, very similar to a random variable in classical probability theory. So in classical probability theory random variables take values. And here measurements, take measurement outcomes. And you always get a random outcome, just the same way random variables is intrinsically random. <br>\n",

    "Measurement connect the quantum world to our classical one: we cannot directly observe the quantum state in nature, we can only gather statistics about it with measurements. It sounds like a harsh boundary between a quantum and a classical system that can only be bridged by measurement. The reality is more subtle: unless a quantum system is perfectly isolated, it interacts with its surrounding environment. This leads to introduction of mixed states, which in one limit recover classical probabilities.\n",
