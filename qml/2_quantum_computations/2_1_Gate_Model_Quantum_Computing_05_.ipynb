    "This discourse will focus on gate-model quantum computing, also referred to as the universal quantum computing model. Unlike classical computing, creating an algorithm for a quantum computer necessitates a different software stack. Consider, for instance, defining a problem such as the Traveling Salesman Problem - seeking the shortest possible route to visit a set of cities. In response to this problem definition, an appropriate quantum algorithm needs to be identified. In this case, we will be examining an optimization algorithm known as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "QAOA is a method that, fundamentally, results in a quantum circuit made up of gates and unitary operations. This represents a low-level description akin to the breakdown of a digital circuit. Further in-depth examination would reveal a layer of compilation. This compilation process serves two essential functions. Firstly, it translates a set of gates, if they are not readily compatible with the quantum computer, to an equivalent set that can be implemented by the hardware. Secondly, in situations where there are non-physically connected qubits which necessitate interaction, the compiler must employ sophisticated strategies to circumvent the connectivity issue. The specifics of these strategies will be further discussed in a dedicated video on quantum implementations. Upon successful compilation, the program can be run on a quantum processor unit (QPU), or alternatively, simulated on a quantum system. While the simulation of approximately 20 to 22 qubits can be handled by a standard laptop, a supercomputer may manage up to 50 qubits before the limitations of classical resources are reached. \n",

    "# Solovay-Kitaev theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solovay-Kitaev theorem is a remarkable statement in the realm of quantum computing. It posits that any unitary operation can be efficiently approximated using a finite number of gates. This theorem underpins the universality of the gate-model quantum computer. Unlike a digital computer, which is universal in its ability to execute any logical operation between bit strings, a quantum computer's universality lies in its ability to take any quantum state and transform it into any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand quantum circuits, we need to examine the process following decomposition and mapping onto gates and qubit registers. One of the simplest gates in quantum computing is the X gate. This gate flips the 0 to 1 and the 1 to 0, which is analogous to the NOT gate in a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike classical computers, which only have a single-bit operation (i.e., the NOT gate), quantum computers possess numerous single-qubit operations. In fact, there are infinitely many quantum single-qubit operations. This can be visualized by mapping any qubit onto the surface of a sphere – a surface with a continuous range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hadamard gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hadamard gate is another vital operation in quantum computing. It transforms the 0 state into an equal superposition of 0 and 1 states. Hence, when the Hadamard gate is applied to the 0 state, the resulting state is an equal superposition of 0 and 1. Likewise, when the Hadamard gate is applied to the 1 state, the outcome is a similar superposition, but with a negative sign attached to the 1 state. This gate enables the generation of equal superpositions and, like the X gate, is just one example of the numerous operations possible on the surface of the sphere in quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The CNOT gate\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, the CNOT gate is a two-qubit operation. It consists of a control qubit and a target qubit. If the control qubit is in state 0, the CNOT gate does not affect the target qubit. However, if the control qubit is in state 1, the CNOT gate applies the NOT operation (X operation) to the target qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if both qubits are initially in the 0,0 state, and the control qubit remains in state 0, the CNOT gate will not change the state of the target qubit. Conversely, if the control qubit changes to state 1, the target qubit will be flipped to state 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the \"Bell state\" or the maximally entangled state, the procedure is as follows:\n",
    "1. Initialize two qubits in the 0,0 state.\n",
    "2. Apply a Hadamard gate to the control qubit, creating an equal superposition of 0 and 1.\n",
    "3. Apply the CNOT gate to both qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon executing these steps, the resulting quantum state will be an equal superposition of the 0,0 state and the 1,1 state. This represents a maximally entangled state with just two qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently, quantum computers can only execute a relatively small number of gate sequences, typically around 10 to 20 gates. The goal is to scale up these devices and enable the execution of increasingly complex and lengthy algorithms. In later discussions, we'll delve into the practical applications of these shallow circuits.\n",

    "So far you mastered the notation of quantum mechanics and quantum computing, understood as much physics as needed to perform various operations on quantum states, and now you are ready to build quantum algorithms. In this notebook, we look at the basics of gate-model quantum computing, which is sometimes also referred to as universal quantum computing. Most academic and commercial efforts to build a quantum computer focus on this model: Alibaba, Baidu, Google, HP, IBM Q, Intel, IonQ, Microsoft, Rigetti Computing, and Tencent all aim at this, and the list keeps expanding. It remains unclear which implementation will prove scalable: superconducting chips, photonic systems, and ion traps are the most common types, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. We abstract away, we focus on the quantum algorithms irrespective of the physical implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Circuits are composed of qubit registers, gates acting on them, and measurements on the registers. To store the outcome of registers, many quantum computing libraries add classical registers to the circuits. Even by this language, you can tell that this is a very low level of programming a computer. It resembles the assembly language of digital computers, in which a program consists of machine code instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubit registers are indexed from 0. We often just say qubit 0, qubit 1, and so on, to refer to the register containing a qubit. This is not to be confused with the actual state of the qubit, which can be $|0\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$, or any superposition thereof. For instance, qubit 0 can be in the state $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the gates. In digital computing, a processor transforms bit strings to bit strings with logical gates. Any bit string can be achieved with just two gates, which makes universal computations possible with simple operations composed only of these two types of gates. It is remarkable and surprising that the same is also true for quantum computers: any unitary operation can be decomposed into elementary gates, and three types of gates are sufficient. This is remarkable since we are talking about transforming continuous-valued probability amplitudes, not just discrete elements. Yet, this result is what provides the high-level theoretical foundation for being able to build a universal quantum computer at all.\n",

    "Note that we can't just initialize the qubit registers in a state we fancy. All registers are initialized in $|0\\rangle$ and creating a desired state is **part** of the circuit. In a sense, arbitrary state preparation is the same as universal quantum computation: the end of the calculation is a state that we desired to prepare. Some states are easier to prepare than others. The above circuit has only two gates to prepare our target state, so it is considered very easy.\n",

    "Let us see what happens in this circuit. The Hadamard gate prepares an equal superposition $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$ in qubit 0. This qubit controls an X gate on qubit 1. Since qubit 0 is in the equal superposition after the Hadamard gate, it will not apply the X gate for the first part of the superposition ($|0\\rangle$) and it will apply the X gate for the second part of the superposition ($|1\\rangle$). Thus we create the final state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)$, and we entangle the two qubit registers.\n",

The only way to make use of superpositions and the strong correlations provided by entanglement is if the entire problem is on the quantum processing unit for the duration of the calculation.\n",

    "This is one task of a quantum compiler. The next one is to translate the gates given in the circuit to the gates implemented in the hardware or the simulator. In the table above, we defined many gates, but a well-chosen set of three is sufficient for universality. For engineering constraints, typically one minimal set of universal gates is implemented in the hardware. It depends on the physical architecture which three.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the number of gates applied is probably already increasing: the decomposition of unitary will create many gates and the translation of gates is also likely to add more gates. An additional problem is the topology of the qubits: in some implementations not all qubit registers are connected to each other. The most popular implementation is superconducting qubits, which are manufactured on silicon chips just like any digital device you have. Since this is a quintessentially two dimensional layout, most qubits on the chip will not be connected. Here is an example topology of eight qubits on a superconducting quantum computer:\n",

    "The total number of gates at the end of the compilation reflects the true requirement of the hardware. *Circuit depth* is the number of time steps required to execute the circuit, assuming that gates acting on distinct qubits can operate in parallel. On current and near-term quantum computers, we want circuits to be shallow, otherwise decoherence or other forms of noise destroy our calculations.\n",
